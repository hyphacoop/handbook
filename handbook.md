## About This Handbook
<!-- Derived from: https://handbook.enspiral.com/#about-this-handbook -->

This Handbook's primary audience is Hypha member-owners and collaborators, but 
it will be publicly available for others who might find it useful. The goal is 
to provide as much clarity and context as possible, while sharing our structures 
and practices with the outside world as well.
