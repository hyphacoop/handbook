Tagline: Undertaking an organizational transformation to become more cross-functional and open to new styles of collaboration while supporting  members' learning, growth, and livelihoods.

This document lays out a path for Hypha to undertake an organizational transformation in order to both address current pain points we are facing while setting a new trajectory that aligns with our mission and vision. Emerging from this transformation, the next form of Hypha will be more resilient, cross-functional, open to experimentation around new styles of collaboration, and have supportive structures in place for members' learning, growth, and livelihoods. Building on 1:1s with each Hypha member and Organizing Working Group discussion, I propose a) we reduce the current operational overhead and streamline the all hands, task, and OKR process (short) b) we replace our WG structure with initiatives and squads (med) c) we pay Hypha members for all [internal] work complemented with budgeting (med-long).

## Background

Hypha has been incorporated since August 2019, but planning kicked off just over 2 years ago in December 2018. In this time we have accomplished much of what we set out to do, however we continue to face lingering issues and concerns as a young organization.

Key concerns that have been mentioned by members are:
- our difficulty meeting OKRs, in particular general operations and business development inflow,
- questions about whether we can maintain our [OKR process](https://handbook.hypha.coop/okrs.html) and
- whether our internal workload is sustainable. 

Responding to these concerns Operations undertook a discussion and series of 1:1 conversations with all Hypha member-workers to surface challenges, concerns, and possibilities for improvement [Appendix A].

## The Problem Space

From these conversations, key issues were surfaced:

- Our OKR process is not working. They are not followed by some working groups, not aligned with day-to-day work, are make-work activities, and it is unclear how they align to the larger organizational strategy
- Hypha organizational strategy and priorities aren't clear. Are not discussed frequently, are not something all members-workers have input in
- Member-workers have limited time and Hypha is one of amongst other professional/personal commitments
- Member-workers do not consistently, if at all, track time. We have no clear picture of how long it takes internally to "reproduce" Hypha
- We have an emerging culture of respect for individuals and of collaborative decisions and seeking consensus, but no group mechanisms for accountability. Members identified sites where that plays out:
    - meetings going over time regularly
    - not setting/meeting deadlines
    - unclear context/expectations of broader members when seeking input or decisions
    - re-adjudicating decisions that have already happened
    - unproductive meetings (we spend a large time going over the same things with no changes)
    - uneven labour, time, and resource distribution out of line with "importance"

But also key opportunities:

- Member-workers identified Hypha as a unique space to work on projects and address areas with a distinctive style
- Hypha has a growing profile and strong reputation in our communities and externally


## Objective

They goal of this proposal is to address these concerns with a few, high pay-off, changes in order to create a resilient, cross-functional, and supportive-yet-flexible organization.

### Proposed Pathway

Our proposed pathway is to transform the organization over the next **six months** by:

**a)** reducing the current operational overhead and streamline the all hands, task, and OKR process (**short term**) 

**b)** replacing our WG structure with initiatives and squads (**medium term**) 

**c)** paying members for all [internal] work complemented with a new budgeting process (**medium-long term**)

Our goal is for the next form of Hypha to  be more resilient, cross-functional, open to experimentation around new styles of collaboration, and have supportive structures in place for members' learning, growth, and livelihoods.

### Other Approaches

The above pathway draws from a range of approaches that member-workers proposed and that Operations WG debated [Appendix B]. This includes:
- Re-evaluate Hypha's sales strategy to secure a few larger clients (>$100k)
    - addresses? mission critical is big clients
    - why? secure more commitments from members
- Delegating more work to smaller working groups [appears this is already happening]
    - addresses? lengthy discussions and slow decision-making in main all hands
    - why? push most decision-making to smaller teams
- Re-org Hypha and revisit the WG structure to be more cross-functional in roles and responsibilities 
    - ask: what working? what hasn't been working? (What were/are our assumptions?)
    - addresses? WGs don't align as group or work to get to key initiatives in OKRs and Strategy
    - why? nimble in composing teams/squads around "initiatives" we've agreed on
- ["Udit's working proposal"](https://hackmd.io/IdzzWcYiQPq_CByhUmWaeg?view#Working-Proposal): Pay members living wage for all labour. Increase cashflow. Make people’s time commitments to Hypha explicit.
    - addresses? This will increase commitment, make people feel valued, and will also lead to better time tracking/financial forecasting. It will alleviate the scarcity mindset.
    - why? by having an account of time people set in, by having cashflow, by having wages, by having accountability through releasing funds after an all hands reporting session


### What are initiatives and squads?

'**Squads**' (borrowing from [Agile, Scrum](https://www.theproducthub.io/2019/10/20/agile-team-organisation-squads-chapters-tribes-and-guilds/), [Spotify](https://www.jeremiahlee.com/posts/failed-squad-goals/) 🤡 and the [Military](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-capital-trends/2016/organizational-models-network-of-teams.html) 😱) are "fully autonomous teams that have end-to-end responsibility" for whatever project they are working on. 

Ideally, for Hypha squads are a ~~autonomous,~~ self-organising team of **2-4 people** who have the skills and tools to design, build, gather feedback or test, and finalize/release on a project. Each squad must have an identified **lead**, long- or medium- term **mission** (3 months to 1 year+) and set purpose. 

To propose a mission-oriented project or **initative**, a member-worker would have to create a <2 page "brief" to describe: the Background/context, the Problem Space, the Objective or thing to try out, the Plan of Action or what needs to happen to make it true, and the indicators to show us on right track. Initiatives can further develop sub-initiatives meeting various other goals/strategies.

Requires:
- Clear roles with responsibilities, grounded in knowing what they contribute to the organization (e.g., designer, front-end developer, project manager)
- Culture of accountability

Risks:
- It didn't work in Spotify, [lesson](https://www.jeremiahlee.com/posts/failed-squad-goals/): "It solved the wrong problem. It fixated on team autonomy (no common process for cross-team collaboration). Collaboration was an assumed competency (Collaboration is a skill that requires knowledge and practice... [big] teams will need dedicated support to guide planning within the team and structure collaboration between teams). Mythology is difficult to change (Pick your FEW areas of innovation. Business units, departments, teams, and managers more effectively communicate organization structure roles and responsibilities)."

Takeway from reviewing materials:
- **"healthy culture heals broken process"**

### What are examples of initiatives?

It isn't easy to find examples of documented internal initiatives, especially in smaller organization including ours. Below is a set of tools people identified using internally as well as some examples of traditional reorganizations and also the popular example, Spotify, which is not applicable to our purpose.

**Team Charter Template** (from [Pingboard](https://pingboard.com/blog/10-best-practices-strategies-for-cross-functional-team-management/)):

As a tool, the team charter can be "a guide for a kick-off meeting agenda and to create a tangible artifact that team members can reference." Has questions for team goals, purpose, roles, practices, measures, guardrails.

![team charter](https://pingboard.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Team-Charter-Template.png)

**Core-team model** (for larger teams):
- Teams with "four to six functional members, under a team leader (or Product Owner). For example, in a development project these leads might include these subject matter experts: program management, product management, engineering, design, manufacturing, and quality assurance." (from [TCGen](https://www.tcgen.com/cross-functional-team))"

![core-team model](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a935f5050a54f184ed366aa/1606929654424-AG5DLNA60HI33CXLN8AS/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kPhv-QnLnHl70m51ucsP1cBZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpwEv36x-EUL2-BSQ5feDhwGOeA_q58oBmCv_n0Nr1r6vSOFC-zFl94m0y4xOhE7YG0/cross-functional-team-diagram.jpg?format=750w)

**Cross-functional teams in larger established organizations** (from [simplicable](https://simplicable.com/new/cross-functional-teams)):
- Sales and Marketing: "An integrated sales and marketing team may perform diverse functions such as lead generation, promotion, pricing, customer service, proposals, and closing"
- Information Tech into Business Units: Combining IT capabilities into business units, to address perceived slowness, lack of responsiveness on a separate IT department
- Product Development: Cross-functional teams for research & development, product development and other innovation functions. For example a product development team with industry, market research, user interface design, visual design, engineering, marketing, finance, manufacturing and supply chain talents.

**Spotify** (let's not look too closely):
- "a long-lived matrix team structure with unusual word choices": teams (squads) organized into a department (tribe) with a product manager. "The teams had designers and software engineers with a range of specializations..." Product managers had a traditional management structure. A product manager for a team reported to their department’s product director (“tribe lead”).

# Appendices

## Appendix A - Aggregated 1:1s

1. **Aspirations and Hypha's role**
  Career aspirations (5 years):

   - full-time employment 
   - stability and focus work (outside of hypha)
   - want to stay associated with hypha, place for work that doesn't fit elsewhere
   - not planning beyond 8 months, not seeing dependency between hypha and other work
   - near-term: figure out working smarter not harder... not being stretched, focused on one thing. current gig/way not sustainable
   - feeling-based way to move all things into hypha if it feels good
   - flexible committment, some periods lots of hypha time, some periods less hypha see a future which will have multiple committmentsmultiple committments
   - near-term want more work through hypa to support myself and the org
   - enjoyed participating in a "social reactor" or fostering spaces like that, would be unstatisfied

   Get out of Hypha:

   - enjoy working with this group of people, happy with that so far
   - a space for learning/using some of the skills that feed into career aspirations (devops, working with people)
   - working with dweb people and likeminded people
   - working with communities
   - "haven't considered not" [working with Hypha] involved in the things "it makes sense to show up" -- don't dislike the work, think it is mostly worthwhile
   - work where bottom-line isn't profitability
   - interesting project work: wholistically: research and execution in the style of hypha
   - ways hypha organizes has helped in other aspects day-to-day participation gives framework to apply elsewhere (passive help)
   - previous experience: lone wolf, now: learning how to work with people
   - want to feel good about the work, caring less about what it's about

Operations WG discussion:

- people thinking closer than 5 years
- feels hypha developing distinct approach/practice and it's forming. like it. want to keep building that --> building in the field. explore that practice in different spaces (e.g., housing in toronto, climate crisis, food security)
- working on collective and more value-aligned. climate crisis.
- **key part to understand more**: how hypha fits into other gigs
- eager about "hypha way" as someone on periphery +2 in discussion
- work-life balance thinking and future FT work in pandemic. stay with FT gig? "how to make your job work for you". how do side-gigs work?

2. **Planning and OKRs**
   General feeling of Hypha:

    - Think we are inefficient and unproductive as org, tho some are hyper productive. a) what friction points? b) how to change that?
    - seems all right, no issues
    - hope to change "lack of will to force to do things to survive in hypha"
    - figuring out how to work best with each other, different personalities and workstyles. not easy match
    - don't enjoy the amount of time
    - don't enjoy the clear situtation of going over time -- hypha time of 30 to 45 mins over
    - can be hard to hold context on original context when asked to make decision
    - trying to figure out what I need to do. ("know" should go to github etc... but haven't created internal process. not as productive)
    - not sure when should contribute
    - still learning how to work together
    - need to distribute our resources better
    - we are "inefficient" (vague term), many wor, many working styles don't match, but can be overcome
    - agree on inefficiency, work styles
    - I think we've put in a lot of work and should be proud, but lots of room for improvement. Excited for the future. With 1.5 years under our belt we are in time to still make changes but starting to get a rhythm
    - we have both too much and not enough process
    - we don't individually respect each others time and/boundaries always
    - org-wide we are risk-adverse in some ways (finances, org capacity) that limits growth
    - still not sure how to work with everyone
    - misalignment of risk sensibilities
        - radically shifting things might be difficult
        - risks re:budgeting
        - bidding and capacity planning

    OKRs:

    - If people follow it helps
    - Sometimes more work to follow the whole thing, that gets in the way of what working group is working on
    - less frequent, less okrs -- more important to get them done than write many things down. be more flexible on format
    - "not working, get rid of them" - in experience doesn't work all the time. Just SMART goals, chunked initatives, some indicators .. then squad up
        - revisit WG structure?
    - working horribly from infra perpsective, maybe because unclear boundaries, stuggled with OKRS, only thought aobut them when looked at them
    - disconnect from day-to-day, additional work to meet.. also work to create
    - some good stuff came out, process ineffecient
    - became task to cross off, but didn't need to get done
    - should slow down OKR cadence
    - feel a failure of our OKRs is not "too much" but that we're not leaned into it enough (OKRs very central in past workplace)
    - too heavy in some ways
    - gap between day to day WG tasks and OKRS
    - think whole OKR process is suspect tbh
    - More concerned with task flow -- we need to narrow the pipe of what people are working on. better curate backlog and sprint

    Minimum Activities we'd need to survive: 

    - Org: can't think of any
    - Infra: maintenance, not sure critical infra
    - Org: 2 clients > $100k "few big clients on recurring agreement" ... need some assurance for internal committment
    - Org: pretty strong correlation between revenue and survival, but Hypha could still exist without revenue
    - Org: monthly operations (e.g. payroll)
    - Org: distribute "mission critical" activities
    - Org: benefits package / health coverage
    - Org: social activity > work/profit

Operations WG discussion:

- not a lot of thought from most folks about "minimum activities" or like an organizational min spec for survival 
- interest about the "no-WGs" proposal (discussed below)

3. **Accountability**

    - following due dates
    - update if you can't finish on time, individual communication: pings 
    - co-work sessions for bigger tasks
    - hold people to deadlines. tasks move slowly without being talked abt again and again. reduce discussions that move nowhere
    - deadlines !!!
    - better granularity of measuring time.. but not track exactly. not everything grouped as internal? subgroups? 
        - WG level but not task level
    - more cultural: how much work you incur (cause) on other members.
        - e.g., like didn't do something and a task came back on other person
        - are we not taking things seriously enough?
    - team chartering exercise: are we missing chartering? making known what is expected of each other and how we work?
    - need internal reflection on how to work day-to-day (not just hypha space). meetings  (and life balance)
    - bad at accountability bc we don't know one other's priorities
    - people finding own patterns of working with one another to be most acountable (uv:dc, ben:uv:mai)
    - respect others time (show up on time, prepared)
        - aim to minimize meetings [that aren't working]
        - think about focused but deep discussions
        - know when don't need to contribute
    - proactive communication
    - honour commitments as much as possible (i.e., commit what you know you can deliver)
    - be clear and specific about asks on one another
    - feel accountable when directly in front of people, being aorund them, but not directly interacting
        - everyone likes working each other
        - not overload the purpose of meetings

    Handling conflict: 

    - process template from recent issues?
    - not sure. haven't stood out moments from reflecting on when it's come up
       - in place cultural practices, coc aborbed
    - what is constrained verus free/undefined
    - some stepping back, not sure if that is the answer
    - mediation process
         - appoint mediator both parties okay with
         - meet to seek understanding all perspectives
         - develop individual plans 
         - have way to write a letter/"notice" in cases where someone doesn't follow plan?
         - ATTUNE: https://ambercreekcounseling.com/staying-attuned-creating-emotional-trust-in-marriage/
         - comm skills collectively: https://www.gottman.com/blog/manage-conflict-the-six-skills/

    Feel your voice able to be heard?

    - I guess, bring up in chat then discuss at call. But not sure about actually doing it
    - think so but not in collective settings
    - a lot of 1:1 convos that isn't shared publicly,
    - hesistant, worry about people's feelings. current culture: prioritize people more than the business - bias to much toward people at expense of the org
    - hard to have convos about direction of org. organizationally those opinions hard to have. too many threads. hard to paint the larger picture
       - could interject, want conversations to be meaningful and recognize pressing things as a group
    - yes, but don't feel equipped to address them: don't know everything you need to know

Operations WG discussion:

- high agreement all hands meetings don't feel productive
- some people pointed to needing each of us to know when they don't need to contribute ("boss would tell us to shutup")
- way we bring up convos in meetings, the get polarized, and only ppl on edges have enough to say
    - couple "takes" dominate, no space to explore problem
- sometimes a struggle with ability to know if they have enough to say
    - "need to know everything to respond" (how do we set these boundaries?)

## Appendix B - Recommendations from 1:1s and Discussion

Full list of discussions from 1:1s and Operations WG discussion:

- Re-evaluate sales strategy
    - addresses? mission critical is big clients
    - why? secure more commitments from members
- Smaller working groups (already happened)
    - [off-the-cuff comment]
    - addresses? lengthy discussions and slow decisions-making in main all hands
    - why? push most decisions making to small wg's
- Re-org to be more cross-functional in roles and responsibilities / Revist WG structure. 
    - ask: what working? what hasn't been working? (What were/are our assumptions?)
    - WGs don't align as group or work to get to key initiatives
    - nimble in composing teams/squads around "initiatives" we've agreed on
        - 1-2 pg "brief" to describe each. written as design brief: thing to try out; make it happen to be true; indicators to show us on right track
        - maybe a few subinitiatives meeting various goals/strategies
    - need very specific understanding of roles in most cases (we don't have that in org)
        - meaning in both initiatives, but also org
        - predicated on knowing what they are grounded in contributing to business (roles)
        - similar to publiclab.org. might inform all hands meeting revamp ->
            - 2 call types: update + discussion. update calls are green/yellow/blue status update on inits.
- ["Udit's working proposal"](https://hackmd.io/IdzzWcYiQPq_CByhUmWaeg?view#Working-Proposal): https://hackmd.io/IdzzWcYiQPq_CByhUmWaeg
    - what? start paying ppl for their time. living wage. accountability.
        - how to pay: membership loans? progressive clips? revenue from products?
    - why? understanding of tiered time commitments of ppl
    - keep task force accountable to init by releasing funds monthly (allhands about reports, not task board)
        - strong preference but not consensus: no bounties
    - what? biweekly okrs/goals. up to task force to complete init. just reports to all-hands.
    - some concern: about incentives. some ppl take 2h, some 18h. how to pay them?
    - also want to guard permission to work slow
    

## Appendix C - Proposed Meeting Reformat from Udit 

Semi annual planning “off site” retreat (1 day + another for 0.5 day for AGM)

- Align on semi annual objectives (4 max) org wide
- Develop a set of key results (10 max)
- Assign key results to working groups
- Use that to allocate quarterly budget to WG’s
- Build culture through unstructured activities

Quarterly planning meeting (2 hours preferably in person)

- Members state their capacities (fill out form beforehand).
- Check in on OKRs
- Check in on wg leads and membership
- Place an upper bound on number of issues that can be in kanban board (per wg based on each wgs stated capacity)

Biweekly All Hands (1 hour remote)

Why do we have an all hands meeting?
- to break the siloing effect of wgs
- to build trust through presence around each other in a structured and ongoing manner
- to rapidly reassign issues to appropriate wgs (leave assigning todos to members)
- for wgs to seek input about issues that concern all members
- to vote on issues that are beyond the limits of any particular wg

What the “all hands” is not good for
- discussing minutia of tasks

Format for all hands
- Check in 
- Announcements
- Project updates
- 2 x Working groups present work through task board
- Discussions - brought forward by a wg or a membees

WG Meetings
- wg lead
- manage tasks and member todos for wg
