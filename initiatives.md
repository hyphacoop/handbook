# Initiatives

⚠️ _Warning: Initiatives are still being set up, they replace working groups. Expect this space to change._ ⚠️

Initiatives are mission-oriented projects that are executed by a self-organising team of 2-4 Hypha members who have the skills and tools to design, build, gather feedback or test, and finalize/release on the project. These include both internal and external-facing projects and tend to be reviewed on a quarterly basis. 

Below we have the list of **active** initiatives as of **2021 Q3**, with full information in our [initiatives database][members] 🔒 and we keep an [archive of our projects][projects] 🔒.
