# Fiscal Sponsorhip

Hypha is a Canadian Fiscal Host on the [Open Collective platform](https://opencollective.com/hyphacoopinc). Our fiscal sponsorship program allows Hypha to support our neighbours by providing a financial home, enabling them to accept and disburse money without having to create their own legal entity and bank account.

Some examples of Collectives include:

- Mutual aid and citizen groups
- Meetup groups and other informal communities
- Grassroot events and conferences
- Shared resources supported by member contributions
- Open source projects and other unincorporated collaborations

Using the Open Collective platform, Collectives can keep transparent financial records and be accountable to funders while staying fully focused on carrying out their positive social impact activities.

The terms of the fiscal sponsorship is described below in the legally binding [Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement](#fiscal-sponsorship-agreement). If you would like to have Hypha as a Fiscal Host, please read through the agreement carefully, then [visit here to apply](http://opencollective.com/hyphacoopinc/apply).

We would like to acknowledge the [Canadian Worker Co-op Federation (CWCF)](https://canadianworker.coop/) for their financial support in helping us launch our fiscal sponsorship program.

## Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement

This Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement sets out how Hypha Worker Co-operative Inc. will provide an umbrella structure under which to operate your Collective, and the ways we will interact.

1. **Parties.**
These are the terms of the relationship entered into between:
{% tooltips title="In this document, Hypha Worker Co-operative Inc. is called ‚ÄúUs‚Äù, ‚Äúfiscal host‚Äù, or ‚ÄúHypha‚Äù, and the Collective is called ‚Äúthe Collective‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou‚Äù." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

    - Hypha Worker Co-operative Inc. (Ontario Corporation No. 5019866) ("Us" or "Hypha"); and
    - the Collective, which has agreed to these terms and conditions ("You" or "the Collective").

  <br />
  This agreement ("Agreement") is entered into with effect from the date ("Effective Date") that you confirm, by ticking the relevant box, that you have read and agree to these terms and that Hypha has accepted your request to include your Collective as part of Hypha and provide support to You for the purposes you described in your application.
  {% tooltips title="These are the terms we agree to when Hypha hosts a Collective. This agreement takes effect when a Collective that has applied to be hosted is approved." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

2. **Recitals.** The parties enter into this Agreement with reference to the following facts:

    1. Hypha is a non-share capital worker co-operative based in Toronto. We are a non-profit organization.

    2. Hypha's mission is to cultivate collective growth and meaningful livelihoods through learning and building technologies together. We work in solidarity with our neighbours, where we support each other and provide safe harbour to imagine and create alternative futures ("Hypha's Mission").

    3. The Collective, with its stated mission, meets the criteria for engaging Hypha as a fiscal sponsor as according to Exhibit A ("Protocols"). The Collective agrees to continue to align with Hypha's Mission in the future.
    {% tooltips title="You told us about your Collective‚Äôs mission when you applied, and we agree that it meets Hypha‚Äôs criteria and aligns with our mission." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

    4. The Collective and Hypha mutually desire to enter a fiscal sponsorship relationship as according to the terms set out in this Agreement.
    {% tooltips title="We want to work together and help you with your Collective, because our missions are in alignment." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

    5. The parties agree that Hypha shall:
    {% tooltips title="We will hold funds and pay them out for your Collective when needed, minus fees. We won‚Äôt use the money for anything else." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

        - receive funds for the Collective ("Funds") to be held by Hypha; and
        - after discussing with You, control these funds for the use of the Collective (less any administrative charges, interest, and expenses).
        <br />&nbsp;

3. **Term.** This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date, and will continue unless and until terminated under clause 10 of this Agreement.
{% tooltips title="This agreement starts when your Collective joins the Hypha fiscal host, and will continue until terminated, (as explained below)." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

4. **Relationship.** Nothing in this Agreement means that the Collective or its members and/or agents is an agent or legal representative of Hypha for any purpose whatsoever except as provided in this Agreement.
{% tooltips title="You can‚Äôt legally represent or act for Hypha, except in the specific ways laid out in this Agreement." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

5. **Protocols.** Hypha has established certain protocols set out in Exhibit A. This sets out how Hypha shall manage and operate and deal with any funds.
{% tooltips title="The protocols for how Hypha will act are set out in Annex A." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

    Hypha will provide the Protocols to the Collective and may from time to time update the Protocols to assist Hypha in performing its obligations effectively.

6. **Funds.** You may solicit unconditional gifts, contributions, sponsorships, and grants to Hypha for the purpose of the Collective, where the payer is not receiving any specific good or service in return.
{% tooltips title="You can receive unconditional funding for your Collective, which will go to Hypha." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

    The Collective understands, acknowledges and agrees that Hypha is not a registered charity or donee organisation, and that such funds collected by Hypha for the Collective will not have donation tax receipts issued for them and will not entitle the giver to a donation tax credit or a tax deduction.
    {% tooltips title="Hypha is not a charity or approved donee organisation so we cannot issue donation tax receipts." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

    If the Collective wishes to accept conditional payments, where the payer receives a specific good or service in return, you must provide notice in writing to Hypha so that we can ensure any applicable Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) or other taxes are applied.
    {% tooltips title="If you want to sell anything subject to GST (products, services, tickets), you must let us know so that we can charge tax." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

7. **Third party agreements.** If You want to enter into any agreement or obligation with a donor, sponsor, vendor or other third party, to provide or receive services beyond simply receiving a donor's financial contributions, you must first provide notice of the specific details to Us and obtain Hypha's prior written consent, as these agreements or obligations will legally be between Hypha and the third party.
{% tooltips title="You need our permission to enter any third party agreements (i.e. any contract for your Collective), because legally the agreement is with Hypha." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

8. **Intellectual property.** Any and all tangible or intangible property, including intellectual property, such as copyrights of the Collective, belong to You. Furthermore, You represent that you have the power and right to advance the Collective. We acknowledge and agree that any trademarks, trade names, artwork, designs, logos, copy, and all other intellectual property  provided to Hypha by the Collective or its agents (for example, to be put on websites) belongs to the Collective and not to Us. For the avoidance of doubt, you should register ownership in the name of an individual associated with the Collective rather than in the name of Hypha.
{% tooltips title="You own the intellectual property of your Collective. You don‚Äôt turn it over to us when we become your fiscal host. If you provide something like a logo for use on your Collective page, it still belongs to you." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

9. **The Collective.** Hypha will receive funds earmarked for support of the Collective, and make disbursements for expenses incurred in furtherance of the Collective.
Beginning on the Effective Date, Hypha will place all such revenues received by Hypha and identified with the Collective into an account
{% tooltips title="We will accept, hold, track, and pay out money for your Collective. We will use that money only for your Collective." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}
to be used for the benefit of the Collective's mission as that mission periodically may be defined by the Collective with the approval of Hypha.
{% tooltips title="You can update your Collective‚Äôs mission, but if it‚Äôs a significant change we‚Äôll need to re-approve it to make sure it still fits our criteria." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}
Hypha will exercise full control over the Collective's financial administration, management, and disbursement of the Fund.
{% tooltips title="We‚Äôll control the money fully, and do all the admin and management related to your budget." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

    For the avoidance of doubt, the parties note that all money will be reported as the income of Hypha, for both tax purposes and for purposes of Hypha's financial statements.
    {% tooltips title="We‚Äôre responsible for taxes and accounting, and money for your Collective will be reported as Hypha‚Äôs income." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}
    Accordingly, Hypha is responsible for the processing and deposit in the Fund of all monies received for the Collective.
    {% tooltips title="You can submit expenses and we‚Äôll pay them out from your Collective‚Äôs funds." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

    We will consult together around any payments to be made out to cover expenses of the Collective as detailed in the Protocols.
    {% tooltips title="Expenses for your Collective are first approved by you, then we‚Äôll review them before paying." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

10. **Termination.** Either Hypha or the Collective may terminate this Agreement on 30 days' written notice to the other party.
{% tooltips title="" %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

    Upon a termination notice being given, the Collective will notify Hypha of how the funds will be dealt with, from the following three options:
    {% tooltips title="You have to decide what to do with any remaining funds if you are shutting your Collective down:" %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

    - submit a request that the balance is paid out as a legitimate Collective expense (submitted and processed as per the Protocols);
    {% tooltips title="withdraw them by submitting an expense" %}üõà {% endtooltips %}
    - donate the funds of the Collective to another Collective hosted by Hypha; or
    {% tooltips title="give them to another Collective we host," %}üõà {% endtooltips %}
    - Hypha will donate the funds to a Canadian registered charity.
    {% tooltips title="or we will donate the funds to charity." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}
    <br />&nbsp;

    If no notice is provided that elects one of these options by the Collective within the 30 days' written notice period, then the default is for the funds to be donated to a registered charity by Hypha (option 3).
    {% tooltips title="If you don‚Äôt tell us which option you choose, we‚Äôll donate the funds to charity." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

    In addition, if no member of the Collective has responded to a request for termination instructions by Hypha for a period of 12 months then the funds will automatically be donated to a registered charity by Hypha.
    {% tooltips title="If you abandon your Collective and don‚Äôt respond to our communications for a year, we‚Äôll donate the money to charity." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

11. **Notice.** Each notice under this Agreement shall be in writing and delivered personally or sent by post or email to the person at the address or email notified in writing from time to time.
{% tooltips title="If you need to give us notice of something relevant to this agreement, it needs to be in writing." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

    A notice is deemed to be received:

    - if delivered personally, when delivered;
    - if posted, five business days after posting; or
    - if sent by email, when actually received.
    <br />&nbsp;

12. **Disputes.** Before taking any Court action, a party must use best efforts to resolve any dispute under, or in connection with, the Agreement through good faith negotiations.
{% tooltips title="If we have a dispute related to this agreement, we will first try to work it out by discussing it together." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

    If there is a dispute between the parties in relation to this Agreement, either party may give the other party notice of the dispute. Within 10 business days of receipt of the notice of dispute, the parties shall meet (in person or online) to endeavour to resolve the dispute.
    {% tooltips title="If that doesn‚Äôt resolve the problem, we will give each other notice, then go to mediation." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

    If the dispute is not resolved within 20 business days of receipt of the notice of the dispute, either party may by notice to the other party refer the dispute to mediation, which will take place in person or online, with each party paying half of the cost of the mediation.

    While any dispute remains unresolved, each party shall continue to perform this Agreement to the extent practicable, but without prejudice to their respective rights and remedies.
    {% tooltips title="While there is a disagreement, we can continue to interact under the terms of this Agreement." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

13. **Liabilities & indemnification.** You are responsible for all activities of the Collective, including any financial or other liabilities, and you indemnify and hold harmless Hypha and its representatives from any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) resulting from your performance of your obligations contained in this Agreement.
{% tooltips title="You are responsible for your Collective‚Äôs activities." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

    You also indemnify Us from any loss or liability resulting from injury (including sickness, disease or loss of life) to any person, or damage to any property of any third party at or as a result of your activities or the Collective.
    {% tooltips title="We are not responsible if you cause loss or damage." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

    You also indemnity Us in relation to any claims from third parties that you have violated any intellectual property laws.
    {% tooltips title="We are not responsible if you breach IP laws." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

14. **Force majeure.** Neither party is liable to the other for any failure to perform its obligations under the Agreement to the extent caused by force majeure (which are events beyond the reasonable control of the affected party, such as a pandemic or natural disaster), provided that the affected party:
{% tooltips title="Neither you nor we are liable if we fail to meet our obligations under this agreement due to events beyond our control, such as a pandemic or natural disaster." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

    - immediately notifies the other party and provides full information about the force majeure;
    - uses best efforts to overcome the force majeure; and
    - continues to perform its obligations to the extent practicable.
    <br />&nbsp;

    Each party must take reasonable steps to mitigate any loss or damage, cost or expense it may suffer or incur arising out of anything done or not done by the other party under or in connection with the Agreement.

15. **Jurisdiction.** This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Ontario and Canada as they apply in Ontario.
{% tooltips title="This agreement is governed by the laws of Canada and Ontario." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

16. **Entire agreement & modification.** This Agreement supersedes any prior oral or written understandings or communications between the parties and constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
{% tooltips title="This agreement is the official one when it comes to the issues it covers, regardless of any other communication or understanding between us." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}
This Agreement may be amended by Us from time to time by posting new versions of these terms on our website and notifying You. By continuing to use the services of Hypha you will confirm that you agree to the modified terms.
{% tooltips title="We can update this agreement. If we do, we will notify you. If you keep using our services, it means you agree to the modified agreement." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

17. **Miscellaneous.** If there is any inconsistency between these terms and any other document submitted by You or any other arrangement with Us, these terms prevail unless otherwise agreed by Us in writing.
    {% tooltips title="If this agreement conflicts with another agreement we‚Äôve made, this document prevails." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

    To waive a right under this Agreement, that waiver must be in writing and signed by the waiving party.
    {% tooltips title="If you don‚Äôt want to enforce a right given to you here, you need to waive it in writing." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

    The parties are independent, and this Agreement does not create any partnership, agency or employment relationship between them.
    {% tooltips title="We are not setting up some other relationship besides what‚Äôs defined here by signing this agreement." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

    If any provision of these terms and conditions is held by any court to be illegal, void or unenforceable, such determination shall not impair the enforceability of the remaining provisions.
    {% tooltips title="If one provision isn‚Äôt enforceable, the rest of the Agreement is still valid." %}üõà {% endtooltips %}

### Exhibit A: Protocols

The following are the policies and processes of Hypha's fiscal sponsorship.

**Criteria:** The Collective will provide evidence and Hypha will confirm that the Collective has met the criteria for engaging Hypha as a fiscal sponsor, being that the Collective has a mission that is value-aligned with Hypha's mission and carry out activities that create positive social impact.

**Hypha fees and expenses:** The Collective will be required to pay membership fees ("Fees") and cover any expenses Hypha incurred on the Collective's behalf as a result of this Agreement. The Collective is responsible to pay from the Fund the Fees that consist of:

- 5% of all of the funds deposited into the Fund, regardless of source, for purposes of becoming a Collective of Hypha and maintaining such membership; or
- any specific amounts agreed between us in writing (due, for example, to there being a specific sum which we agree to look after for a specific fee); and
- all interest earned on the Fund which will be retained in Hypha's general fund.

**Payment processor expenses:** In addition to the Fees, the Collective is responsible for any merchant account credit card processing expenses incurred by Hypha as a result of administration of the Fund, which are directly related to the Collective's purpose. Such expenses shall be pulled directly from the Fund by Hypha.

**Platform:** Upon execution of this Agreement, the Collective will be featured on Open Collective, an accounting and crowdfunding platform (the "Platform"), specifically on Hypha's page, which is owned by Hypha.

Hypha will set the Collective up on the Platform such that the Collective will have its own dedicated page that tracks, in total transparency, the funds that it raises and the expenses it incurs in relation to the Collective.

The Collective's page on the Platform will be linked to Hypha's Stripe account, PayPal account, TransferWise account, and bank account, so that Hypha has control over the funds received and disbursed under the Platform for purposes of the Collective. The Platform thus serves as a fundraising avenue for the Collective, enabling it to raise funds and be reimbursed for expenses incurred in relation to the Collective.

The Platform makes the revenue and expenses of the Collective available to the public through a transparent ledger.

**Disbursements:** In order to receive a disbursement from the funds raised to cover expenses incurred in furtherance of the Collective, those seeking payment must submit receipts/invoices onto the Platform for review by the Hypha staff, via the "Submit Expense" feature on the Collective's page.

Upon Hypha's receipt of receipts/invoices, it will review all documentation to ensure the expenses incurred are valid. Upon approval by the Hypha staff, Hypha will reimburse those expenses to the payee through the Platform using PayPal, TransferWise, bank transfer, or another mutually agreed payment option. Each time Hypha reimburses the Collective for such expenses, the funds allocated to the Collective on the Platform will automatically decrease by the amount reimbursed.

**Funds received & expenses paid outside platform:** In the event that the Collective receives funding outside of the Platform (that which does not go automatically and directly into the Fund), Hypha will use a feature enabled on the Platform to 'Manually Add Funds' to the Collective's balance. This means that Hypha will assign the funds received in the Fund destined to the Collective, thus increasing its budget. In the same fashion, if an expense is paid outside of the Platform by the Collective, because, for example, the recipient does not hold a PayPal account or another payout method is required, then Hypha will use the 'Mark as Paid' feature on the Platform, which allows Hypha to record that an expense has already been paid through a different method and that amount is automatically deducted from the Collective's Fund balance.
