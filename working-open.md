# Working Open

Hypha operates with democratic organizing principles informed by our [values](./vision.md#values). As part of that, we've developed a set of guidelines for how (and exactly what) and why we work in the open.

## Why?

- In order to share and provide opportunities for self- and collective- learning as we work in solidarity with others seeking to create meaningful livelihoods.
- Not because "default to open" is an ideal in itself, but because it orients us toward negotiating a set of practices around our shared intentions.
- Yet we recognize openly sharing might prevent frank and necessary discussion beneficial to our members, and so we want to clearly lay out our practices of consent and privacy.

# How and what?

- We currently accommodate redactions and going off-the-record for meeting notes. Participants can request to stop taking notes, or redact and correct notes after they have been taken.
- We recognize that some information should be treated as sensitive and confidential for the benefit of Hypha and its clients and partners. An employee or contractor with access to such information is responsible for keeping this information confidential.
