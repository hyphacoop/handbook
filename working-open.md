# Working Open

Hypha operates with democratic organizing principles informed by our [values](./values.md). As part of that we've developed a set of guidelines for how (and exactly what) and why we work in the open.

## Why?

- In order to share, provide opportunities for self- and collective- learning as we work alongside other new economy projects.
- Not because a "default to open" is an ideal, but because it orients us toward negotiations a set of practices around our shared intentions.
- Yet we recognize openly sharing might prevent frank and necessary discussion beneficial to our members, and so we want to clearly lay our our practices of consent and privacy

# How and what?

- We currently work with a [*in camera*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_camera)/redaction request for meeting notes, where at any point members can request to stop taking notes, or redact and correct notes after they have been taken

**Default open to all**:

- Meeting notes (all hands, working groups) and final documents (handbook), on GitHub and other platforms ðŸ‘€
- Aggregated financal statements ðŸ‘€

* *This would include source repositories and code (e.g., on GitHub) and other process materials based on consensus on licensing and usage constraints.*
