# Working Open

Hypha operates with democratic organizing principles informed by our [values](./vision.md#values). As part of that, we've developed a set of guidelines for how (and exactly what) and why we work in the open.

## Why?

- In order to share and provide opportunities for self- and collective- learning as we work in solidarity with others seeking to create meaningful livelihoods.
- Not because "default to open" is an ideal in itself, but because it orients us toward negotiating a set of practices around our shared intentions.
- Yet we recognize openly sharing might prevent frank and necessary discussion beneficial to our members, and so we want to clearly lay out our practices of consent and privacy.

# How and what?

- We currently accommodate redactions and going off-the-record for meeting notes. Participants can request to stop taking notes, or redact and correct notes after they have been taken.
