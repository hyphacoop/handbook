## 6. SURPLUS, LOSS AND INTERNAL CAPITAL ACCOUNTS

  1. **Definitions**

    The *net worth* is the difference between the assets and liabilities of
    the Co-operative’s books, kept according to generally accepted
    accounting principles. Where liabilities exceed assets, the net worth is
    negative.

    The *internal capital accounts* reflect the allocation of the net worth
    of the Co-operative among individual members’ capital accounts and the
    reserves. The sum of the balances in the internal capital accounts is
    the net worth of the Co-operative.

    An *individual member’s capital account* records the part of the net
    worth contributed by and credited to each member through direct
    investment by the member in the form of member loans and by the
    investment of patronage returns determined by the member’s share of
    labour patronage described in section 6.1.

    The *reserve* is the collective portion of the net worth that is not to
    be returned to the individual members. An *indivisible* reserve is never
    divided among members, it is permanent co-operative capital that
    represents the value of the common effort of the members. The
    indivisible reserve is like any other retained earnings and controlled
    by members while the Co-operative is operating however they will not be
    available to the individual members if the Co-operative ceases to exist.

    The *net income* is the book net income for the financial year, after
    interest on member loans and special allocations, computed in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles.

    The *surplus* or *loss* with respect to a financial year of the
    Co-operative is:

    I.  the book net income or loss for the financial year;  

    II. less tax payable on the net income of the Co-operative;  

    III. plus the amount of tax on the income of the Co-operative  
        recoverable owing to a loss for that financial year;

    IV. all as computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting
        principles consistently applied and after payment or recovery of
        income tax on the Co-operative’s income. If the total is positive,
        it is a surplus. If the total is negative, it is a loss.

    The *labour patronage* of a member is the total hours worked for the
    Co-operative during the financial year regardless of the rate of pay.
    Work performed while a probationary member or a casual worker shall not
    be included in the calculation of labour patronage. A minimum of 16
    hours must be contributed by the member in any year before labour
    patronage will be calculated.

    The *member’s share of labour patronage* is the individual’s labour
    patronage divided by the total labour patronage of all members.

    The *patronage return* is the amount that is allocated, credited or paid
    in each fiscal year to members based on the business done by them with
    or through the Co-operative.

  1. **Member Loans** – The Co-operative may hold loans from its members.
    These loans may result from:

    A.  mandatory deductions from wages paid by the Co-operative, as may be
        required by and at a rate set by the board of directors;  
    B.  the retention of interest paid on an individual member’s loans;  
    C.  the retention of an individual member’s portion of net income; or  
    D.  voluntary loans made by the member to the Co-operative.  

    Interest rates paid on member loans shall be the lesser of: the
    prescribed maximum annual percentage of 2% above the prime rate
    established by the Bank of Canada on the first day of the month before
    the month in which the rate of interest is set, or an annual percentage
    determined by the board of directors.

  1. **Reserves** – The reserve funds are held in a general reserve
    account and consist of the collective portion of the net worth that
    is not returned to the members based on the allocation as defined in
    section 6.4. All reserve funds are indivisible and allocated into
    specific reserve accounts in order to maintain a general reserve for
    rainy days, support member and coop development, and provide
    solidarity to movement-building projects.

  2. **Allocation of Net Income, Surplus, and Loss** – At the end of each
    financial year, the finance working group shall calculate interest
    due on member loans and credit this interest to the loan portion of
    their individual member’s capital account. The board of directors
    may, according to operating policies approved by the members, assign
    special allocations to individual members’ capital accounts, in
    recognition of past uncompensated contributions to the Co-operative.

    In the event of a surplus, the net income shall be credited to internal
    capital accounts as follows:

    A.  80 percent of net income less the co-op’s taxes shall be credited to
        the reserve funds as defined in section 6.3. The distribution into
        specific reverse accounts will be determined by a resolution passed
        at the AGM based on proposals brought forward that further the
        mission of the Co-operative;  
    B.  the remaining net income shall be credited to the loan portion of
        the individual member’s capital account, according to each member’s
        share of labour patronage.  

    In the event of a loss, the loss shall be allocated as follows:

    A.  50 percent shall be charged against the general reserve account,
        unless this exceeds the reserve account balance, in which case the
        full balance of the reserve shall be charged, and  
    B.  the remainder shall be charged against the individual member’s
        capital account,  

    in proportion to each member’s share of labour patronage.

    After this allocation is made, as cash flow and capital requirements
    permit, the board of directors may direct the Co-operative to pay out in
    cash a fixed percentage of all member loans as they stand after the
    year’s surplus or loss allocations. The balance of the individual member’s
    capital account shall be adjusted accordingly.

    Within 3 months after the end of every financial year, the treasurer
    shall provide all members with a statement showing the amount of their
    loan accounts in the Co-operative.

## 7. FINANCIAL

  1. **Financial Year** - The financial year of the Co-operative
    shall end on **June 30** each year.

    all debts and liabilities, including loans, any remaining
    property shall be distributed to a co-op development fund, a
    federation or another co-operative organization as shall be
    identified by a resolution of the Co-operative.

## 8. MANAGEMENT OF CO-OPERATIVE

Management and general supervision of the business of the Co-operative
shall, subject to the direction of the board, be undertaken by its
members through their participation in working groups. Within limits

have the power to enter into contracts in the name of the Co-operative.
Such contracts shall be binding on the Co-operative.

## 10. AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATION

    amended in accordance with Section 70 of the Act. Neither these

    purpose.
