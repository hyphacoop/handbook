# Meetings

The purpose of this resource is to share details about how and when we
meet.

We have specific guides for [scheduling][scheduling] and
[hosting][hosting] meetings.

## Types

All meetings are expected to have someone in the **Cultivator** &
**Notetaker** [roles](/roles.md).

### All Hands

All Hands meetings are our general sync-up. We all try our best to be
there. We adjust regularity and format of meetings based on time of
year, member workload (inside and outside co-op), and needs of
organization-wide initiatives.

ðŸ“† **Schedule:** We currently meet every 2 weeks, alternating between
format of a short **standup** and a **full** meeting.

#### Full
ðŸ•™ **Duration:** 60 minutes  
ðŸ“‹ **Template:** [`link.hypha.coop/template`](https://link.hypha.coop/template)

This format involves: review of previous action items, working group
updates, announcements, etc. (See template for specifics.)

#### Standup
ðŸ•™ **Duration:** 15 minutes  
ðŸ“‹ **Template:** [`link.hypha.coop/standup-template`](https://link.hypha.coop/standup-template)

This format involves rotating through each meeting participant and
having them answer 3 questions about past and future intentions and
blocks to those. (See template for specifics.)

We expect no longer than **3 minutes per person**. If people have more
to say, they're welcome to stay after the close of he call to discuss.

## Calendar Holds

Holds are unclaimed spots in our shared schedule when most members are
available, that we try to leave open. They could be used for:

- Discussions requiring the whole organization
- Last-minute or urgent meetings, for which a new scheduling is
  difficult

We periodically re-poll members for the best time, often using our
up-to-date [weekly availability schedules][schedules].
