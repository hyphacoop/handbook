## Types

All formal meetings are expected to have someone in the **Cultivator** &
**Notetaker** [roles][roles].


### All Hands

📆 **Schedule:** Biweekly  
🕙 **Duration:** 60 minutes   
📋 **Template:** [`link.hypha.coop/template`](https://link.hypha.coop/template)

All Hands meetings are our general sync-up. We all try our best to be there. These meetings are intended to enable cross-initiative discussion, provide a space to seek input, build trust through co-presense, to identify and re-assign issues to appropriate initiatives, to vote and consense on organization-wide decisions. 

This format involves: check-ins, announcements, initiative updates, and discussions (See template for specifics). We adjust the regularity and format based on our workload (inside and outside co-op), the time of year, and the needs of organization-wide initiatives.


### Quarterly Planning 🐛🌱🎛️ 

📆 **Schedule:** Every 3 months (supplanted by retreat and AGM)   
🕙 **Duration:** 2.0 hours   
📋 **Template:** 

Quarterly Planning meetings are our place to sync on strategic goals and initiative progress and timelines. We also make some organization-wide decisions on priorities and member capacity. This is a place to vote and consense on organization-wide decisions. It is important for us all to be there, preferrably in-person. 

This format involves: check-ins, announcements, initiative updates and budgeting, member and organization capacity, and finances.


### Semi-annual Retreat 🌴🍹

📆 **Schedule:** Every 6 months (co-scheduled with AGM every second retreat)   
🕙 **Duration:** 1 day   
📋 **Template:** 

Semi-annual Retreat meetings are our place to propose strategic goals (3-5), align on initiatives, develop key results (measures) and links those to both goals and initatives, to identify and re-assign issues to appropriate initiatives, to vote and consense on organization-wide decisions and build trust through co-presense. 
It is important for us all to be there, preferrably in-person.

This format involves: check-ins, announcements, strategic goal development, initiative updates and budgeting, member and organization capacity, and finances. We adjust the specific scheduling based on our workload and timing of organization-wide initiatives.


### Initiative Calls

📆 **Schedule:** As needed
🕙 **Duration:** As needed  
📋 **Template:** [`link.hypha.coop/wg-template`](https://link.hypha.coop/wg-template)

These meetings are set up by initiative leads and member-workers on an as needed basis to enable the work of initatives, manage tasks and check-in on progress.


### Annual Members Meeting ☀️🛰️

📆 **Schedule:** Annually, per our [Bylaws][bylaws-3] they "shall be held within 4 months of the fiscal year end and within 15 months of any previous annual meetings", with appropriate notice given  
🕙 **Duration:** 0.5 day  
📋 **Template:**  

Annual members meetings (AGMs) are our annual review where we elect the board, accept finance statements, and hear updates on the work done over the previous year. We schedule this with a board meeting and strategic retreat and adjust the specific scheduling based on timing of organization-wide initiatives.

#### Special Members Meeting

This format is a variation of the members meeting that can be called by the board or any 20% portion of the active members to cover urgent matters that can't be handled at a All Hands (e.g., something requiring a formal motion or vote by the member).


### Board Meeting

📆 **Schedule:** As often as required with appropriate notice, per our [Bylaws][bylaws-4]
🕙 **Duration:** 60 mins  
📋 **Template:** 

Board of Directors meetings are our ad hoc meetings open to all members where the board conducts votes on and approves resolutions. Meetings have to happen at least annually in order to approve resolutions in advance or arising from members meetings. We tend to schedule this with the annual members meeting and strategic retreat.


### Social Time 

Much more casual than meetings, these social activities do not require formal cultivation and notetaking.

#### Social humpday hang 🍄🌻

📆 **Schedule:** Monthly, last Wednesday during our standing [All Hands](#all-hands) time  
🕙 **Duration:** 60 mins  

Casual social hangout with an activity led by the [Cultivator][cultivator] and sometimes including outside collaborators.

#### Coffee Break! ☕

📆 **Schedule:** Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday afternoons  
🕙 **Duration:** 15 mins  

Casual drop-in space in our main BBB room without an official structure.


## Calendar Holds

Holds are unclaimed spots in our shared schedule when most members are
available, that we try to leave open. They could be used for:

- Discussions requiring the whole organization
- Last-minute or urgent meetings, for which a new scheduling is
  difficult

We periodically re-poll members for the best time, often using our
up-to-date [weekly availability schedules][schedules].
