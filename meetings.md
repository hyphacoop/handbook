# Meetings

The purpose of this resource is to share details about how and when we
meet.

We have specific guides for [scheduling][scheduling] and
[hosting][hosting] meetings.

## Types

All formal meetings are expected to have someone in the **Cultivator** &
**Notetaker** [roles][roles].


### All Hands

📆 **Schedule:** We currently meet every 2 weeks  
🕙 **Duration:** 60 minutes  
📋 **Template:** [`link.hypha.coop/template`](https://link.hypha.coop/template)

All Hands meetings are our general sync-up. We all try our best to be
there. We adjust regularity and format of meetings based on time of
year, member workload (inside and outside co-op), and needs of
organization-wide initiatives.

This format involves: review of previous action items, working group
updates, announcements, etc. (See template for specifics.)


### Annual Members Meeting

📆 **Schedule:** Annually, according to our [Bylaws][bylaws] they "shall be held within 4 months of the fiscal year end and within 15 months of any previous annual meetings", with appropriate notice given  
🕙 **Duration:** 0.5 day  
📋 **Template:** 

Members meetings are our annual review where we elect the board, accept finance statements, and hear updates on the work done over the previous year. We tend to schedule this with a board meeting and strategic retreat.

#### Special Members Meeting

This format is a variation of the members meeting that can be called by the board or any 20% portion of the active members to cover urgent matters that can't be handled at a All Hands (e.g., something requiring a formal motion or vote by the member).


### Board Meeting

📆 **Schedule:** As often as required, with appropriate notice  
🕙 **Duration:** 60 mins  
📋 **Template:** 

Board meetings are our ad hoc meetings open to all members where the board conducts votes on and approves resolutions. Meetings have to happen at least annually in order to approve resolutions in advance or arising from members meetings. We tend to schedule this with the annual members meeting and strategic retreat.


### Social Time 

Much more casual than meetings, these social activities do not require formal cultivation and notetaking.

#### Social humpday hang 🍄🌻

📆 **Schedule:** Monthly, last Wednesday during our standing [All Hands](#all-hands) time  
🕙 **Duration:** 60 mins  

Casual social hangout with an activity led by the [Cultivator][cultivator] and sometimes including outside collaborators.

### Coffee Break! ☕

📆 **Schedule:** Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday afternoons  
🕙 **Duration:** 15 mins  

Casual drop-in space in our main BBB room without an official structure.


## Calendar Holds

Holds are unclaimed spots in our shared schedule when most members are
available, that we try to leave open. They could be used for:

- Discussions requiring the whole organization
- Last-minute or urgent meetings, for which a new scheduling is
  difficult

We periodically re-poll members for the best time, often using our
up-to-date [weekly availability schedules][schedules].
