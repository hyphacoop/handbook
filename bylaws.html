<ol>
<li><p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
<p>The <em>net worth</em> is the difference between the assets and liabilities of
the Co-operative&#x2019;s books, kept according to generally accepted
accounting principles. Where liabilities exceed assets, the net worth is
negative.</p>
<p>The <em>internal capital accounts</em> reflect the allocation of the net worth
of the Co-operative among individual members&#x2019; capital accounts and the
reserves. The sum of the balances in the internal capital accounts is
the net worth of the Co-operative.</p>
<p>An <em>individual member&#x2019;s capital account</em> records the part of the net
worth contributed by and credited to each member through direct
investment by the member in the form of member loans and by the
investment of patronage returns determined by the member&#x2019;s share of
labour patronage described in section 6.1.</p>
<p>The <em>reserve</em> is the collective portion of the net worth that is not to
be returned to the individual members. An <em>indivisible</em> reserve is never
divided among members, it is permanent co-operative capital that
represents the value of the common effort of the members. The
indivisible reserve is like any other retained earnings and controlled
by members while the Co-operative is operating however they will not be
available to the individual members if the Co-operative ceases to exist.</p>
<p>The <em>net income</em> is the book net income for the financial year, after
interest on member loans and special allocations, computed in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<p>The <em>surplus</em> or <em>loss</em> with respect to a financial year of the
Co-operative is:</p>
<p>I.  the book net income or loss for the financial year;  </p>
<p>II. less tax payable on the net income of the Co-operative;  </p>
<p>III. plus the amount of tax on the income of the Co-operative<br>   recoverable owing to a loss for that financial year;</p>
<p>IV. all as computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting
   principles consistently applied and after payment or recovery of
   income tax on the Co-operative&#x2019;s income. If the total is positive,
   it is a surplus. If the total is negative, it is a loss.</p>
<p>The <em>labour patronage</em> of a member is the total hours worked for the
Co-operative during the financial year regardless of the rate of pay.
Work performed while a probationary member or a casual worker shall not
be included in the calculation of labour patronage. A minimum of 16
hours must be contributed by the member in any year before labour
patronage will be calculated.</p>
<p>The <em>member&#x2019;s share of labour patronage</em> is the individual&#x2019;s labour
patronage divided by the total labour patronage of all members.</p>
<p>The <em>patronage return</em> is the amount that is allocated, credited or paid
in each fiscal year to members based on the business done by them with
or through the Co-operative.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Member Loans</strong> &#x2013; The Co-operative may hold loans from its members.
These loans may result from:</p>
<p>A.  mandatory deductions from wages paid by the Co-operative, as may be
   required by and at a rate set by the board of directors;<br>B.  the retention of interest paid on an individual member&#x2019;s loans;<br>C.  the retention of an individual member&#x2019;s portion of net income; or<br>D.  voluntary loans made by the member to the Co-operative.  </p>
<p>Interest rates paid on member loans shall be the lesser of: the
prescribed maximum annual percentage of 2% above the prime rate
established by the Bank of Canadaon the first day of the month before
the month in which the rate of interest is set, or an annual percentage
determined by the board of directors.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Reserves</strong> &#x2013; The reserve funds are held in a general reserve
account and consist of the collective portion of the net worth that
is not returned to the members based on the allocation as defined in
section 6.4. All reserve funds are indivisible and allocated into
specific reserve accounts in order to maintain a general reserve for
rainy days, support member and coop development, and provide
solidarity to movement-building projects.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Allocation of Net Income, Surplus, and Loss</strong> &#x2013; At the end of each
financial year, the finance working group shall calculate interest
due on member loans and credit this interest to the loan portion of
their individual member&#x2019;s capital account. The board of directors
may, according to operating policies approved by the members, assign
special allocations to individual members&#x2019; capital accounts, in
recognition of past uncompensated contributions to the Co-operative.</p>
<p>In the event of a surplus, the net income shall be credited to internal
capital accounts as follows:</p>
<p>A.  80 percent of net income less the co-op&#x2019;s taxes shall be credited to
   the reserve funds as defined in section 6.3. The distribution into
   specific reverse accounts will be determined by a resolution passed
   at the AGM based on proposals brought forward that further the
   mission of the Co-operative;<br>B.  the remaining net income shall be credited to the loan portion of
   the individual member&#x2019;s capital account, according to each member&#x2019;s
   share of labour patronage.  </p>
<p>In the event of a loss, the loss shall be allocated as follows:</p>
<p>A.  50 percent shall be charged against the general reserve account,
   unless this exceeds the reserve account balance, in which case the
   full balance of the reserve shall be charged, and<br>B.  the remainder shall be charged against the individual member&#x2019;s
   capital account,  </p>
<p>in proportion to each member&#x2019;s share of labour patronage.</p>
<p>After this allocation is made, as cash flow and capital requirements
permit, the board of directors may direct the Co-operative to pay out in
cash a fixed percentage of all member loans as they stand after the
year&#x2019;s surplus allocations. The balance of the individual member&#x2019;s
capital account shall be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>Within 3 months after the end of every financial year, the treasurer
shall provide all members with a statement showing the amount of their
loan accounts in the Co-operative.</p>
