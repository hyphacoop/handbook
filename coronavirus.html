<p>Like others in the Great Lakes region and Toronto, we&#x2019;ve been closely monitoring the Novel Coronavirus 2019 situation. With the pace the situation has evolved since the World Health Organization <a href="https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020" target="_blank">declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11</a>, we can assume that things will continue to change rapidly in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
<p>In order to stay safe as workers and community members during this we&apos;ve drafted this document, which contains our pandemic-specific policies and guidance, resources, and information on business and personal supports for responding to COVID-19. It was last updated on <strong>May 20, 2020</strong>.</p>

<p>As a remote-first organization with many member-owners additionally working outside Hypha we occupy a slightly unique position. On the one hand our own work can transition to a work from home (WFH) strategy, but the continuity of Hypha work may have additional impacts we should be mindful of.</p>
<p>After a process of research, consultation, and review of our requirements as an employer, Hypha has adopted the following policy to protect ourselves as member-owners and to protect the communities we serve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Member-owner&apos;s work should continue from home/safe environments<ul>
<li>Client work and internal meetings will continue as virtual meetings</li>
<li>Work-related travel or professional gatherings/onsite meetings will be moved to virtual hosting or be rescheduled to a time when public health officials have deemed it safe to do so</li>
<li>Due to the nature of our work (virtual office, remote) we <strong>are not providing</strong> <a href="#personal-protective-equipment-ppe">Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</a> at this time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Member-owners should take care of the health (including mental health) of themselves and their loved ones first<ul>
<li>We encourage all member-owners to <strong>take the time they need right now, it&apos;s not business as usual</strong></li>
<li><strong>You are your own best judge</strong> of how much client work you can take on and track during this time</li>
<li><strong>Please communicate and be proactive</strong> to other member-owners around shifting work and deadlines </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Any questions and concerns should be brought to the <strong>Operations WG</strong> and our main coordinator for internal COVID-19 is <strong>Dawn</strong>, who you can also contact directly.</p>
<p>We will have COVID-19 check-in as a standing item at all hands to address any questions and provide updates.</p>

<p><strong>All employees have the right to refuse unsafe work</strong>, specifically, work that would endanger your immediate or long term health or that of another worker (<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90o01#BK80" target="_blank">Ontario&#x2019;s <em>Occupational Health and Safety Act</em>, Section 43</a>).

<p>As an employer we recognize/commit to the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Our duty is to provide the safest workplace for our employees (and our communities)</li>
<li>We follow public health guidelines on preventing COVID-19 spread though social distancing</li>
<li>We will honour our employment agreements</li>
<li>We will be responsive to member-owners needs in implementing additional measures</li>

<ul>
<li>Due to the virtual nature of our workplace, we <strong>are not currently providing</strong> PPE, which serves as &quot;droplet and contact&quot; controls</li>
<li>For those working in non-healthcare settings PPE takes the form of access to hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes, gloves, and surgical/cotton masks. Public health literature identifies PPE controls as &quot;the last tier in the hierarchy and should not be relied on as a stand-alone primary prevention program&quot; <sub><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/routine-practices-precautions-healthcare-associated-infections/part-a.html" target="_blank">source</a></sub></li>

<ul>
<li>If you <strong>suspect you have symptoms</strong> of COVID-19 or have been in close contact with someone who has it, use the <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/self-assessment/" target="_blank">Ontario self-assessment tool</a> to determine how to seek further care: <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/self-assessment/" target="_blank">https://covid-19.ontario.ca/self-assessment/</a></li>
<li>If you need to <strong>seek testing</strong> to determine whether you have COVID-19, you are able to do so and are highly encouraged to seek it <ul>
<li>We encourage you to seek testing if you suspect you have COVID-19</li>
<li>While awaiting results, Hypha will respect quarantine and self-isolation protocols and encourage you to follow them</li>
<li>If there is a way Hypha can assist with material aspects (e.g., delivering stuff) let Operations WG know</li>

<p>Three risks to our critical processes and our approach to maintaining them:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>An employee tests positive, gets sick, or starts taking care of someone who is sick. </p>
<ul>
<li>This leads to Hypha not having people to do the work we committed to. Our initial approach to handling this includes:<ul>
<li>having per-client conversations on projects with &quot;single leads&quot; as needed</li>
<li>developing readiness within Hypha to hire contractors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This leads to employees responsible for critical organizational processes (e.g., Finance WG for invoicing and payroll) not being present. Our initial approach to handling this includes:<ul>
<li>ensuring access to financial systems (e.g., Banking, TransferWise, Wagepoint) and knowledge to use them is distributed beyond single point of failure</li>
<li>reviewing the documentation we have and identifying areas for improvement</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Our self-hosted virtual office infrastructure (e.g., Jitsi, Loomio, chat, email) goes down and Infra WG and/or key members who maintain it are unreachable, or we do not have physical access. Our initial approach to handling this includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensuring access and control is distributed beyond single point of failure</li>
<li>reviewing the documentation we have and identifying areas for improvement</li>
<li>identifying physical location of servers hosting services </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>No client work comes in and we experience a loss of revenue that severely impacts our projected revenue and ability to cover year-end organization expenses. Our initial approach to handling this includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>committing to offer ROEs to furlough employees to access EI/CERB individually</li>
<li>applying for federal SME COVID-19 supports, including BCAP and payroll subsidies</li>
<li>ensuring Hypha is equipped to enter hibernation mode</li>
</ul>
</li>
