# Emergency Contacts: Information for Employees/Members

## Purpose

This document outlines our approach to Emergency Contacts in alignment with our Occupational Health & Safety Policy. While we work remotely, there may be rare but critical situations, such as being unexpectedly unreachable or an emergency during an in-person gathering, where having up-to-date emergency contact information allows us to respond quickly and responsibly.

## Who Should I Choose?

This is entirely up to you and not dependent on familial ties or "next of kin" relationships. Here are some things to think about when choosing your roster of Emergency Contacts: 

- Do they live or work close enough to check on me if there's a concern about my health or safety?
- Can they access my home (e.g. they live with me or have a spare key)?
- Would my dependents or pets feel safe with them entering the home unannounced?
- Do they reliably check and answer their phone?
- Do I trust them to act in my best interests in an emergency?
- Can they contact others I'd want informed, and are they willing to do so?

This is not an exhaustive list, and any one question may not entirely disqualify someone from being your emergency contact. These are simply things to consider. 

## Where Do I Send My List?

Please send your list of 2-3 Emergency Contacts, in the order you prefer we contact them, to [operations@hypha.coop](mailto:operations@hypha.coop)

## Anything Else I Should Know?

- You can send your Emergency Contacts this [one-pager on what they can expect](emergency-contacts-what-to-expect.md). 
- You can also review this [Operations Working Group Emergency Contact Process](emergency-contacts-process.md) if you're interested.
