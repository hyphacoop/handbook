# (Interpersonal) Incident Response Process

## July 2025

## Purpose

This process has been developed to provide a clear, fair, and supportive process for addressing interpersonal incidents between anyone at Hypha that may breach the [Respect in the Workplace Policy](../Policies/respect-in-workplace.md), the [Conflict of Values Philosophy](../Policies/conflict-of-values.md), or any other internal policy, philosophy, or process at Hypha. 

## Roles & Responsibilities

**Affected Member(s) / "Complainant(s)":**

* Person(s) who are directly impacted by the incident.  
* All members have the right to bring forward a report and request support.

**Reported Member(s) / "Respondant(s)":**

* Person(s) whose actions have been identified as concerning.  
* A respondent will have a fair opportunity to respond and participate in the resolution.

**Witness(es):**

* Person(s) who witnessed (saw, heard, read, etc.) the incident, and were not directly impacted.   
* In the event that an incident occurs in a group channel where a written record of the incident is present in the chat (clear evidence), a witness may be called upon to engage in this process if they have additional information or context to share. 

**Support Person(s):**

* Optional: anyone chosen by a member engaged in this process for emotional or logistical support.  
* This person, who may be a member or not, may attend meetings or check-ins, but does not lead or direct the process.

**Incident Response Lead (IR Lead):**

* A designated member from the Operations Working Group (OWG) who is responsible for facilitating the process.  
* This Lead must maintain neutrality and ensure confidentiality, fairness, and timely follow-up.  
* If a member of the OWG is engaged in the process in any way other than Leading (if they are in any of the above roles), they will be recused from leading this process. 

**Optional External Support:**

* A third-party mediator or consultant may be engaged if the OWG deems it necessary due to conflict complexity or capacity.

## Incident Response Process Steps

These steps are in alignment with the ["Options & Actions Following Unacceptable Workplace Behaviour"](../Policies/respect-in-workplace.md#options--actions-following-unacceptable-workplace-behaviour) and ["Complaint Investigation Steps"](../Policies/respect-in-workplace.md#complaint-investigation-steps) sections of our [Respect in the Workplace Policy](../Policies/respect-in-workplace.md). As a reminder, the tl;dr steps as outlined in the Respect in the Workplace Policy are: 

1. [Conflict Transformation Process](../Policies/conflict-transformation.md)  
2. Formal Internal Investigation  
3. Formal External Investigation  
   1. Complaint Investigation Steps: Where an internal or external investigation is required, the following steps will be taken by Hypha and/or the engaged HR and/or Legal consultant:   
      1. The "respondent(s)" will be informed of the complaint;  
      2. The "complainant(s)" will be interviewed, as well as any person involved in the incident and any identified witnesses;   
      3. Any other person who may have knowledge of the incidents related to the complaint or any other similar incidents will also be interviewed.  
      4. A copy of the written complaint detailing the complainant's allegations will then be provided to the respondent(s).    
      5. The respondent(s) is invited to reply in writing to the complainant's allegations, and the reply will be made known to the complainant before the investigation proceeds further.  
      6. A written letter outlining the result of an investigation and any remedial action will be given to the employees involved, and appropriate disciplinary measures will be taken as soon as possible.  
      7. All documents associated with a workplace harassment complaint, incident, and/or investigation will be kept for a minimum of two years from the conclusion of the investigation.

Here, we've fleshed out the steps in this process for further clarity and guidance, and it applies to any interpersonal incident within Hypha. 

When a report of an interpersonal incident is made under this policy, the following steps will be followed by the IR Lead and/or the OWG, and, where applicable, an external mediator or investigator:

1. Report or Notice of Incident:  
   1. Any member can report an incident involving themselves or witnessed behaviour.  
   2. Reports may be made:  
      1. Verbally (in person or via call/video call)  
      2. In writing (email, [designated anonymous form](https://forms.gle/QVZTeEz6sapCvJTM6), or element channel/private chat)  
   3. Where available, reports should include a description of the incident (date, time, location, people involved, etc.)  
2. Acknowledgement of Report:   
   1. The IR Lead will acknowledge receipt of the report within 5 working days.   
      1. If the report is received anonymously, there can be no acknowledgement directly to the reporter. However, the OWG will take all reports seriously and continue this process as best they can with the information they have.  
   2. Where possible, the complainant(s) will be contacted by the IR Lead for a private check-in to clarify their experience, needs, and preferences for next steps (support with [Conflict Transformation](../Policies/conflict-transformation.md), informal resolution, or formal investigation).  
3. Preliminary Assessment:  
   1. The IR Lead will assess the nature and seriousness of the report to determine:  
      1. Whether immediate safety measures or accommodations are necessary.  
      2. Whether the report will proceed through informal resolution, formal investigation, or another appropriate path.  
4. Facilitation of Informal Resolution (If Reasonable):  
   1. If both the complainant(s) and respondent(s) agree, and the situation is appropriate for informal resolution:  
      1. The IR Lead, or external mediator or investigator, may recommend a dialogue or facilitated conversation between the complainant and respondent, mediation, or other appropriate process, such as the [Conflict Transformation Process](../Policies/conflict-transformation.md).  
      2. Where appropriate, any defined outcomes and agreements will be documented, with signed consent from all parties.  
5. Informing the Reported Member(s):  
   1. If a formal investigation is being initiated, the respondent(s) will be notified of the complaint and provided:  
      1. A summary or written copy of the allegations.  
      2. An invitation to respond in writing within a set timeframe (typically 5â€“10 working days).  
      3. The complainant(s) will be informed when the respondent(s)'s response is received.  
6. Information Gathering & Analysis:  
   1. The IR Lead, or an appointed investigator (internal or external), will:  
      1. Interview the complainants, respondents, and any identified witnesses, including any additional individuals who may have knowledge relevant to the incident(s).  
      2. Collect any available supporting documentation, communications, or evidence offered by involved parties.  
      3. Analyze the information gathered through interviews and documentation, draw a conclusion, and provide recommendations for next steps.   
7. Conclusion of Investigation / Resolution:  
   1. Once all interviews, information gathering, analysis of collected information, and informal resolution (if applicable) are complete, the IR Lead or external mediator/investigator will:   
      1. Provide a written report summarizing all findings, conclusions, and recommended actions.  
      2. Share the report findings and recommendations with all parties involved in the process, in a summary letter, with as much transparency as confidentiality will allow.  
8. Remedial Actions & Follow-Up:  
   1. If a policy violation(s) is found, the OWG will facilitate appropriate corrective or disciplinary actions in line with Hypha values and legal obligations.  
   2. In some cases, a signed resolution agreement, which would be documented, shared only with involved parties, and securely stored, may be recommended. This could include:   
      1. Apologies or acknowledgments  
      2. Commitments to behaviour changes  
      3. Training or coaching  
      4. Adjustments to work arrangements  
   3. Follow-up meetings will be offered by the OWG to all involved parties to ensure:  
      1. Agreed-upon actions are upheld.  
      2. Ongoing support needs are effectively addressed.  
9. Documentation & Recordkeeping:  
   1. All documentation related to the incident, resolution, and investigation will be kept securely in the OWG Sensitive Google Drive for a minimum of two years from the conclusion of the process.  
   2. Records will include:  
      1. Reports and complaints  
      2. Interview notes  
      3. Written responses  
      4. Evidence when applicable  
      5. Investigation summaries and outcome documents  
      6. Resolution agreements  
   3. Access to records will be strictly limited to those facilitating or legally required to review them.  
      1. In the event that an OWG member is an involved party within an investigation, aside from the IR Lead role, and therefore, should not have access to the investigation documentation (which would normally be filed in the Sensitive Google Drive to which they have access), a separate confidential drive will be created and this member will not be granted access.   
10. Action & Accountability:  
    1. Members found in violation of our policies and philosophies may face corrective actions up to and including removal from membership, contractual engagement, or employment, depending on the circumstances.  
    2. Where reasonable and applicable, an emphasis will be placed on accountability, harm repair, and prevention of future incidents, rather than punitive measures.
