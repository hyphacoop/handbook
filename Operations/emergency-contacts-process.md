# Emergency Contacts: The Process

## Purpose

This document provides a clear, consistent process for when and how the Hypha Operations Working Group (OWG) reaches out to a team member's Emergency Contact (EC).

## When Do We Call an Emergency Contact? 

An EC may be contacted if:

- The team member is unexpectedly unreachable for an extended period during scheduled work time, and there's concern for their well-being.
- An emergency occurs during an in-person gathering or virtual meeting (e.g., accident, medical event).
- The employee has communicated something that raises an immediate concern about their health or safety.

An EC should **not** be contacted for performance, attendance, or non-urgent issues.

## What's the Process?

**Check In Internally:** Review the situation carefully and check for any updates (e.g., Element, calendar, known illness, time off).

**Escalate to the OWG:** Notify the OWG, who will use their shared judgment to assess whether EC contact is appropriate based on the criteria above. The OWG will select an Emergency Manager (EM), who will drive the process as the leading point of contact. 

**Prepare for the Call:** Locate the most recent EC information, stored in the Operations Sensitive Google Drive. The EM will prepare to make the call while another member of the OWG (delegated by the EM) will begin documenting the decision and rationale. 

**Make the Call(s):** The EM will make the call to the first person on the Hypha team member's EC list. If the EC does not answer the call, the EM will leave a voice message and then proceed to call the next person on the team member's EC list. During the call or voicemail, the EM will:
- State their name, the company, and why they're reaching out.
- Be clear but compassionate; share only necessary details.
- Request that Hypha be kept aware of any appropriate updates via the number they have called from.

If no one on the team member's EC list answers their phone, proceed to text messaging, again starting from the top of the list and moving down in priority order. 

**Document the Call(s):** The EM will document the call(s) and/or text message(s), including date, time, contact made, and outcome in the same document used to record the decision and rationale. The EM will also update any internal folks as appropriate. 

## Please Note

- If an emergency occurs during an in-person gathering or virtual meeting, please use your best judgment to determine whether to contact emergency medical services first. 
- In rare cases where a team member cannot be reached and their Emergency Contacts are also unreachable, the Operations team may consider requesting a wellness check. We recognize that involving police is not a safe or comfortable option for everyone, and we will prioritize alternatives whenever possible. The OWG will assess the situation with care, use their best judgement, and choose an approach that centres the team member's safety, dignity, and well-being.
