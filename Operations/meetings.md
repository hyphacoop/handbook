## Scheduling a meeting

_Note: Consider whether this meeting might be a global interest to other
members. Skip the steps below at your discretion for low-stakes topics._

- Try to announce your intention to schedule a meeting on a topic and ask
  who's interested in participating. Allow _at least_ 48 hours for people to respond.
- Consider who might be most interested and what timing might work for
  them.
  - Check the [`availability` calendar for travel/vacation plans][availability].
  - Check everyone's [availability `schedules`][schedules].
- If 2-3 candidate timeslots feel obvious from looking at people's
  availabilities:
  - Reserve them all in [Hypha calendar][calendar] immediately, for example: `HOLD:
    Infrastructure Meeting (Option 1)`
  - Ask in chat whether anyone who wants to attend has any blocks on any
    of the options
- If short-notice or speed of booking is important:
  - Claim an open HOLD [:information_source:](../How-we-work/meetings.md#calendar-holds) slot.
    - If time permits or topic isn't an all-hands matter, consider
      leaving the hold available for someone else
    - If claiming a hold, edit the calendar immediately and announce
      meeting in chat
- If your must find a new timeslot:
  - Create a new poll (we currently use [When2Meet](https://www.when2meet.com/))
  - Leave ample time for completion (ideally 1 week)
  - Check on non-responders in following days and send (gentle)
    reminders as needed

  - create a stub agenda as soon as possible (can be done before scheduling)
    - Hint: use [an agenda `template`][template]

  - update the [organizational calendar][calendar] as early as possible with candidate and finalized time slots
    progresses

    into agenda from chat

  - update [meeting index][meetings] as best location changes
    (hackmd => review (PR) => file)
