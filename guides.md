# Guides

Guides explain in practical terms how we do stuff. Any Hypha member can
change these.<sup>[1](#references)</sup>

We are inspired by the idea of "protocols" from the [Lab
Book][clear-lab-book] of the [Civic Laboratory for Environmental Action
Research (CLEAR)][clear]

> Protocols are the "attitudes" or "the manner in which one approaches each and
every element in our space." They are different than pure rules or
instructions; they are ways that we establish order and maintain practices
across our group [...] -- They define the way we ought to proceed or behave in
different situations. As such, they are normative, or premised on values,
morals, and an idea of how things ought to be done. They are a manifestation of
our values.

## Scheduling a meeting

Note: Consider whether this meeting might be a global interest to other
members. Skip below steps at your discretion for low-stakes topics.

- Try to announce your intention to schedule a meeting on a topic, and ask
  who's interested to participate. Allow a day for people to respond.
- Consider who might be most interested, and what timing might work for
  them.
  - Check the [monthly `availability` calendar for travel/vacation plans][availability].
  - Check everyone's [weekly availability `schedules`][schedules].
- If 2-3 candidate timeslots feel obvious from looking at internal
  availabilities:
  - Reserve them all in [Hypha calendar][calendar] immediately, for example: `HOLD:
    Infrastructure Meeting (Option 1)`
  - Ask in chat whether anyone who wants to attend has any blocks on any
    of the options.
- If short-notice or speed of booking is important:
  - Claim an open HOLD [:information_source:](/meetings.md#holds) slot.
    - If time permits or topic isn't an all-hands matter, consider
      leaving the hold available for someone else.
    - If claiming a hold, edit the calendar immediately, and announce
      meeting in chat.
- If your must find a new timeslot:
  - Create a new poll. (We currently use [When2Meet](https://www.when2meet.com/).)
  - Try to leave ample time for completion (up to 1 week?).
  - Check on non-responders in following days, and poke them.

## Hosting a meeting

- **Before** the meeting...
  - create a stub agenda as soon as possible (can be done before scheduling)
    - Hint: use [an agenda `template`][template].
  - add the agenda to the [`meetings` index][meetings].
  - update the [organizational calendar][calendar] as event scheduling
    progresses.
  - mention the meeting time in chat, and link the agenda.
  - encourage migration of related actions, decisions and discussions
    into agenda from chat
- **During** the meeting...
  - ask for agenda items (start of meeting)
  - facilitate discussion
  - keep time
  - call attention to action items, upcoming decisions and discussions
- **After** the meeting...
  - add important dates/reminders to calendar
  - review and merge notes
  - update [meeting index][meetings] as best location changes
    (hackmd => review (PR) => file)
  - as needed, set up loomio threads and decisions
  - as needed, send reminders of action items
  - future: migrate action items into task tracker
