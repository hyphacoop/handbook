# SSH Keys

To add your SSH public key to the ansible server, you need to create a pull request against the [configuration](https://github.com/hyphacoop/configurations/tree/main/hyphacoop/ssh-public-keys) GitHub repo. Once merged, someone from who already has access to the ansible server must re-run the ansible server script to update the changes.
