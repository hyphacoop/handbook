# Timesheets

Members log their work hours using [Clockify](https://clockify.me), and project timesheets may be generated to determine the invoice amount each period for some clients, and often for calculating member wages.
This process is done using the Clockify [Summary Report](https://clockify.me/reports/summary).
Shared reports are found under [Shared Reports](https://clockify.me/reports/shared).

## Setting up a new project

When a project begins, generate a [Summary Report](https://clockify.me/reports/summary) for the project:

1. Select the appropriate `Client` (and/or `Project`) and `Billing` filters
![timesheets-0](images/timesheets-0.png)

1. Configure the table headings to `Group by: Project > User > Description`

1. Click the share button to reveal the `Share report` dialog
![timesheets-1](images/timesheets-1.png)

1. Name the report `project_YYYYMM` where `YYYYMM` indicates the first month the project is active, leave the `Lock dates` unlocked, and select the appropriate `Visibility` for the project

1. You can now find the link to your project under [Shared Reports](https://clockify.me/reports/shared)

## Generating project timesheets

1. To generate timesheets, open the Shared Report for your project (e.g. [meetcoop_202005](https://clockify.me/shared/5ee22fd6486d877565000755)) and export as PDF for the applicable report period (to be sent to client, if applicable)

1. Timesheet PDFs sent to clients or for internal payroll calculation should be archived in our [shared drive](https://link.hypha.coop/drive) under the `Timesheets` directory
