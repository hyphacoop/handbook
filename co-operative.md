# Hypha Worker Co-operative

## About Us 

Hypha Worker Co-operative Inc. is a worker co-operative incorporated on August 
1, 2019 in Ontario, Canada (Ontario Corporation No. 5019866).

Hypha is incorporated as a **non-share capital** worker co-operative under the 
[*Ontario Co-operative Corporations Act, 1990*][coop-act]. 
This entails specific conditions on our primary object, size of membership, 
and role of members, as addressed in Article [1], [144.1], and [145] of the Act.

We are a non-profit _organization_. 
That means our organization does not operate with the primary purpose of generating profit. 
As per 2017's [_Cutting Unnecessary Red Tape Act_](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/s17020), 
Hypha falls under neither the current [_Corporations Act_](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90c38), 
nor the upcoming [_Not-for-Profit Corporations Act_](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/10n15), 
which both govern not-for-profit _corporations_ in Ontario.
Instead, we are a [not-for-profit _co-operative_][not-for-profit-coop].

Hypha is a member of [Canadian Worker Co-op Federation (CWCF)](https://canadianworker.coop/), 
and through that affiliation is a member of the [Ontario Co-operative Association (OCA)](https://ontario.coop/) and [Cooperatives and Mutuals Canada (CMC)](https://canada.coop/).<sup>[1](#notes)</sup>

## Members and Employees

Every **member-worker**, or **member** in short, is both a member and an employee of Hypha.
There are seven members, all of which are founding members, with six also serving as directors.

A **member**:
  - Has completed a membership application (and/or been officially welcomed into 
    the membership)
  - Is a *founding*, or *permanent*, member if they are one of the seven members who founded Hypha
  - Is considered:
    - *active* if they have not requested to change their status
    - *inactive* if they have requested to change their status
      - Inactive members are unable to vote, serve as a director, participate in 
        projects, or work as an employee for so long as they remain so
      - Inactive members can request to become active at any time

An **employee**: 
  - Works as an *employee* under a *contract of service* with Hypha, see the [CWCF's "Guidelines for Determining Whether or Not There Is an Employer-Employee Relationship in a worker Co-op"][cwcf-guidelines] for clarification
  - Is "someone who performs work for an employer for wages," meeting the 
    [*Employment Standards Act, 2000*][es-act] [definition of employee][esa-employee] 
  - Is considered *permanent* if they:
    - Have completed a probationary period of one year 
    - Are not working under contract

A **contractor**:
  - Works as an *independent* contractor under a *contract for service* with Hypha
  - Provides services clearly specified in a time-limited contractor agreement
  - May be a natural person or incorporated entity, domestic or foreign

A **collaborator**:
  - Participates in open Hypha activities and projects without a formal employment
    relationship

As every member holds a dual position as both a member and an employee of Hypha,
they must make a distinction between *member duties* and *employee work*.
Our bylaws do not allow for members to be contractors and we currently do not employ *dependent contractors*.
Members are expected to acknowledge these components of their relationship with Hypha by signing the *Membership Acknowledgement*.

Employees, as well as contractors and collaborators engaged in certain initiatives with Hypha,
are expected to sign an *Employee and Contractor Intellectual Property Agreement* and comply with
[tax obligations as applicable to them](https://handbook.hypha.coop/finance.html#gsthst-rt).

As a worker co-operative, there are specific conditions regarding members and employees, 
addressed in Article [1], [144.1] and [145] of the [*Ontario Co-operative Corporations Act*][coop-act]. 
A summary is provided below:

> Article 1 (1)
> "Worker co-operative" means a co-operative whose primary object is to provide employment to its members and as a condition of membership that, except in certain circumstances, a member must be employed by the co-operative (roughly at least 75 % of all employees are members of the co-operative, there are specific exemptions).
>
> Article 1 (1.2) (and repeated in 144.1 (2))
> An employee is not a permanent full-time employee if they are employed for a probationary period of one year or less; are employed under a contract for a term of two years or less; or have regular hours of work [that are] less than fifteen hours per week.
>
> Article 145 (4)  
> The co-operative must maintain a minimum of three members.
