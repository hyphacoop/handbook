## The Co-operative

Hypha Worker Co-operative Inc. is a worker co-operative incorporated on August 
1, 2019 in Ontario, Canada (Ontario Corporation No. 5019866).

Hypha is incorporated as a **non-share capital** worker co-operative under the 
[*Ontario Co-operative Corporations Act, 1990*][coop-act]. 
This entails specific conditions on our primary object, size of membership, 
and role of members, as addressed in Article [1], [144.1], and [145] of the Act.

We are a non-profit _organization_. 
That means our organization does not operate with the primary purpose of generating profit. 
As per 2017's [_Cutting Unnecessary Red Tape Act_](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/s17020), 
Hypha falls under neither the current [_Corporations Act_](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90c38), 
nor the upcoming [_Not-for-Profit Corporations Act_](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/10n15), 
which both govern not-for-profit _corporations_ in Ontario.
Instead, we are a [not-for-profit _co-operative_][not-for-profit-coop].

Hypha is a member of [Canadian Worker Co-op Federation (CWCF)](https://canadianworker.coop/), 
and through that affiliation is a member of the [Ontario Co-operative Association (OCA)](https://ontario.coop/) and [Cooperatives and Mutuals Canada (CMC)](https://canada.coop/).<sup>[1](#notes)</sup>
