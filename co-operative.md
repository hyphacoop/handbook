# Hypha Worker Co-operative

## About Us 

Hypha Worker Co-operative Inc. is a worker co-operative incorporated on August 
1, 2019 in Ontario, Canada (Ontario Corporation No. 5019866).

Hypha is incorporated as a **non-share capital** worker co-operative under the 
[*Ontario Co-operative Corporations Act, 1990*][coop-act]. This entails specific 
conditions on our primary object, size of membership, and role of members, as addressed in 
Article [1], [1.1], [144] and [145.1] of the Act.

We are a non-profit _organization_. As per 2017's [_Cutting Unnecessary Red Tape Act_](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/s17020), Hypha falls under neither the current [_Corporations Act_](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90c38), nor the upcoming [_Not-for-Profit Corporations Act_](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/10n15), which both govern not-for-profit _corporations_ in Ontario.
