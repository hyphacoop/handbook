# Social Media & External Communication Policy

## Purpose

This policy establishes expectations for how everyone at Hypha represents the co-op in public spaces, online, and in media. It aims to protect Hypha's reputation and brand while respecting everyone's personal expression.

## Scope

This policy applies to everyone at Hypha when:

* Speaking on behalf of Hypha  
* Participating in external events, such as conferences or panels, as an identified member of Hypha.  
* Wearing or carrying Hypha-branded swag such as clothing, badges, stickers, etc.  
* Posting, commenting, or otherwise sharing on social media or other platforms in a way that connects them to Hypha. This applies to Hypha's own social media accounts and each person's personal social media account. 

## Guidelines

**Personal vs. Hypha Voice**: Everyone at Hypha must distinguish between personal opinions and Hypha positions. When speaking or posting on behalf of Hypha, be mindful of the co-op voice and values. *Note: when adding commentary to your personal social media post when re-sharing something posted by Hypha, these voices are already inherently separated.* 

**Respect and Professionalism:** When representing the organization, communicate respectfully, inclusively, and professionally. Avoid language or behaviour that could reasonably harm the organization's reputation or harm an individual or group.

* *The terms "respect" and "professionalism" are often used in workplace contexts with the intention of forcing dominant cultural norms upon folks, rather than fostering actual mutual care. For us, this is not about "enforcing a standard". It's about upholding the dignity, humanity, and lived realities of others.*

**Confidentiality:** Do not share internal, confidential, or sensitive information outside of Hypha without the membership's approval.

**Use of Branding:** The Hypha name, logo, or branded materials must not be used in any way that may imply Hypha's endorsement of personal projects, opinions, or outside activities without the membership's approval. If you have any questions about branding, you can visit the [Look and Feel](../Hypha-Worker-Co-operative/look-and-feel.md) page of our handbook. 

**Media and Public Requests:** For any media inquiries or external requests for comment about Hypha, please connect with the Communications working group.

**Social Media Conduct:** On personal accounts, everyone at Hypha is free to post their own views. However, if their Hypha affiliation is visible, they should use discretion. Please avoid statements that could reasonably be viewed as harmful to Hypha's brand or community relationships.

## Monitoring

Hypha does *not* monitor the personal accounts of its members. Concerns will be addressed by the Operations Working Group (OWG) only if raised with clear evidence of a violation of this policy. Example: someone at Hypha shares a link to your social media post with the OWG while flagging a concern. The OWG would assess whether the post breaches this or any of our Hypha policies (such as [Respect in the Workplace](../Policies/respect-in-workplace.md), [Conflict of Interest](../Policies/conflict-of-interest.md), etc.) and follow the [incident response process](../Operations/emergency-contacts-process.md) if appropriate.

## Violations

Breaches in this policy may result in corrective action, which may include:

* Informal conversations or coaching.  
* Temporary or permanent removal from external-facing roles or Hypha's social media accounts.   
* Disciplinary procedures, up to and including removal from membership.

## Freedom from Reprisal: Justice & Social Justice Activism

The aim is for everyone at Hypha to feel safe speaking up and taking meaningful action on issues of justice and social justice without fear of retaliation. Whether through conversations at work or lawful activities outside of it, like posting on social media, joining rallies, or organizing for change, we will not penalize employees for standing up for what they believe in. *We do, however, encourage you to be mindful that not everyone has the capacity to engage in conversations concerning traumatic events at work.* 

If you ever feel you've faced retaliation from anyone at Hypha, you can reach out to the Operations Working Group. Concerns will be taken seriously and handled with care and in accordance with our [Incident Response Process](../Operations/emergency-contacts-process.md). 

We also understand that justice work can be heavy, and we encourage you to use the supports available to us at Hypha, such as your Paid Time Off and mental health benefits, when you need time to rest and take care of yourself or loved ones.

Note: This protection does not extend to hate speech, harassment, or harmful or unlawful actions.
