# Internal Communications

## Purpose

Clear, respectful communication keeps Hypha aligned, connected, and accountable. This communications landing page outlines how we stay in sync across time zones, projects, and roles, along with how we speak to each other in ways that support trust, collaboration, and care.

## How We Communicate

### How We Keep Each Other in the Loop

Most of our work is done asynchronously, and we heavily rely on documentation and coordination tools to stay aligned. Our goal is to make it easy to find what's happening, who's doing what, and what needs attention.

* **Default to transparency.** Share updates in public channels or documents unless there's a clear reason not to (ex., Confidentiality obligations).  
* **Tag responsibly**. Use @ mentions to notify folks who need to see something, not to create an urgency that doesn't exist.  
* **Acknowledge information.** Where it makes sense to do so, use reactions or replies to show you've seen or absorbed something.  
* **Keep things organized.** Use appropriate element channels for discussing topics. If you notice that a topic is drifting into something suitable for a different channel, say so and move the conversation there.

For specifics, please see:

* [Meetings](../How-we-work/meetings.md): When and how we meet  
* [Working Open](../Policies/working-open.md): Guidelines for how (and exactly what) and why we work in the open.  
* [Roles](../How-we-work/roles.md): Who's responsible for what (in meetings, working groups, practice areas, etc.)

### How We Speak to One Another

Communication at Hypha is rooted in respect, accountability, and a commitment to shared growth. 

* **Be direct and kind.** Say what you mean with intention and care. Try to assume good intent, avoid passive aggression, and address harm or conflict early when possible.  
* **Respect different communication styles and capacities.** Not everyone will process information or respond in the same way (or on the same timeline).  
* **Choose the right setting.** Sensitive conversations should happen in appropriate spaces. Most of our work happens asynchronously. However, sometimes a live video call feels better than async back-and-forth.   
* **Conflict is normal.** What matters is how we respond. Refer to our [Conflict Transformation](../Policies/conflict-transformation.md) practices to engage in a healthy resolution.  
* **No tolerance for harassment, hate, or discrimination.** Respect in the workplace is a non-negotiable. Please see our [Respect in the Workplace](../Policies/respect-in-workplace.md) Policy for more.
