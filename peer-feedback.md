# Peer Feedback

We have a developing system of peer feedback to set self-development goals and receive feedback over the course of the year. Around Quarterly Planning meetings, Semi-Annual Retreats, and the Members meetings we have checkins.

## Pair / pod folks for feedback (have a random distribution below)

1. 5 minutes to reflect on work over last year and areas to identify: 
    - at least 1 thing you did well
    - 1-3 things you'd like to improve
2. 15 mins share with your partner
    - before you start, review this handout on feedback, together if helpful: https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/feedback.pdf
    - discuss with your partner!
    - try to identify how to take action around addressing what you want to improve 
3. periodic check-in (at quarterly calls)
    - record these personal feedback and actionable approaches, you will check in with your peer around the next quarterly meeting

Random Distribution Process: _By dice_ roll 7 dice using https://www.random.org/dice/?num=7, work left from right and assign, skip once you have 3 then 2 of a number, re-roll if necessary. _By random list_ copy our initials into https://www.random.org/lists/, press randomize and group into 2, 2, 3.
