## How We Use Data
Our [BigBlueButton server](https://bbb.hypha.coop) keeps a database for registered users and room information. This information is not backed up.

Uploaded presentations are kept for 5 days after you have ended your meeting and log history is kept for 28 days. These are BigBlueButton's default configurations and automated purging is performed by the software.

Our Jitsi instance we keep standard system logs for debugging purpose only.
