In the tradition of their founders, \ncooperative members believe in the ethical values of honesty, openness, \nsocial responsibility and caring for others.\nSeven Principles\n\nVoluntary and Open MembershipCooperatives are voluntary organisations, \nopen to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, \nwithout gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination.\nDemocratic Member ControlCooperatives are democratic organisations controlled by their members, \nwho actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. \nMen and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. \nIn primary cooperatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) \nand cooperatives at other levels are also organised in a democratic manner.\nMember Economic ParticipationMembers contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their cooperative. \nAt least part of that capital is usually the common property of the cooperative. \nMembers usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of membership. \nMembers allocate surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: developing their cooperative, \npossibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible; \nbenefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the cooperative; \nand supporting other activities approved by the membership.\nAutonomy and IndependenceCooperatives are autonomous, self-help organisations controlled by their members. \nIf they enter into agreements with other organisations, including governments, \nor raise capital from external sources, \nthey do so on terms that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their cooperative autonomy.\nEducation, Training, and InformationCooperatives provide education and training for their members, elected representatives, \nmanagers, and employees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their co-operatives. \nThey inform the general public - particularly young people and opinion leaders - about the nature and benefits of co-operation.\nCooperation among CooperativesCooperatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the cooperative movement by working together through local, \nnational, regional and international structures.\nConcern for CommunityCooperatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members.\n\n\n"},"bylaws.html":{"url":"bylaws.html","title":"Bylaws","keywords":"","body":"Bylaws\nBylaws adopted: June 13, 2020\n1.

SURPLUS, LOSS AND INTERNAL CAPITAL ACCOUNTS\n\nDefinitions\nThe net worth is the difference between the assets and liabilities of\nthe Co-operative’s books, kept according to generally accepted\naccounting principles. Where liabilities exceed assets, the net worth is\nnegative.\nThe internal capital accounts reflect the allocation of the net worth\nof the Co-operative among individual members’ capital accounts and the\nreserves. The sum of the balances in the internal capital accounts is\nthe net worth of the Co-operative.\nAn individual member’s capital account records the part of the net\nworth contributed by and credited to each member through direct\ninvestment by the member in the form of member loans and by the\ninvestment of patronage returns determined by the member’s share of\nlabour patronage described in section 6.1.\nThe reserve is the collective portion of the net worth that is not to\nbe returned to the individual members. An indivisible reserve is never\ndivided among members, it is permanent co-operative capital that\nrepresents the value of the common effort of the members. The\nindivisible reserve is like any other retained earnings and controlled\nby members while the Co-operative is operating however they will not be\navailable to the individual members if the Co-operative ceases to exist.\nThe net income is the book net income for the financial year, after\ninterest on member loans and special allocations, computed in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe surplus or loss with respect to a financial year of the\nCo-operative is:\nI.  the book net income or loss for the financial year;  \nII. less tax payable on the net income of the Co-operative;  \nIII. plus the amount of tax on the income of the Co-operative   recoverable owing to a loss for that financial year;\nIV. all as computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting\n   principles consistently applied and after payment or recovery of\n   income tax on the Co-operative’s income. If the total is positive,\n   it is a surplus. If the total is negative, it is a loss.\nThe labour patronage of a member is the total hours worked for the\nCo-operative during the financial year regardless of the rate of pay.\nWork performed while a probationary member or a casual worker shall not\nbe included in the calculation of labour patronage. A minimum of 16\nhours must be contributed by the member in any year before labour\npatronage will be calculated.\nThe member’s share of labour patronage is the individual’s labour\npatronage divided by the total labour patronage of all members.\nThe patronage return is the amount that is allocated, credited or paid\nin each fiscal year to members based on the business done by them with\nor through the Co-operative.\n\nMember Loans – The Co-operative may hold loans from its members.\nThese loans may result from:\nA.  mandatory deductions from wages paid by the Co-operative, as may be\n   required by and at a rate set by the board of directors;B.  the retention of interest paid on an individual member’s loans;C.  the retention of an individual member’s portion of net income; orD.  voluntary loans made by the member to the Co-operative.  \nInterest rates paid on member loans shall be the lesser of: the\nprescribed maximum annual percentage of 2% above the prime rate\nestablished by the Bank of Canada on the first day of the month before\nthe month in which the rate of interest is set, or an annual percentage\ndetermined by the board of directors.\n\nReserves – The reserve funds are held in a general reserve\naccount and consist of the collective portion of the net worth that\nis not returned to the members based on the allocation as defined in\nsection 6.4. All reserve funds are indivisible and allocated into\nspecific reserve accounts in order to maintain a general reserve for\nrainy days, support member and coop development, and provide\nsolidarity to movement-building projects.\n\nAllocation of Net Income, Surplus, and Loss – At the end of each\nfinancial year, the finance working group shall calculate interest\ndue on member loans and credit this interest to the loan portion of\ntheir individual member’s capital account. The board of directors\nmay, according to operating policies approved by the members, assign\nspecial allocations to individual members’ capital accounts, in\nrecognition of past uncompensated contributions to the Co-operative.\nIn the event of a surplus, the net income shall be credited to internal\ncapital accounts as follows:\nA.  80 percent of net income less the co-op’s taxes shall be credited to\n   the reserve funds as defined in section 6.3. The distribution into\n   specific reverse accounts will be determined by a resolution passed\n   at the AGM based on proposals brought forward that further the\n   mission of the Co-operative;B.  the remaining net income shall be credited to the loan portion of\n   the individual member’s capital account, according to each member’s\n   share of labour patronage.  \nIn the event of a loss, the loss shall be allocated as follows:\nA.  50 percent shall be charged against the general reserve account,\n   unless this exceeds the reserve account balance, in which case the\n   full balance of the reserve shall be charged, andB.  the remainder shall be charged against the individual member’s\n   capital account,  \nin proportion to each member’s share of labour patronage.\nAfter this allocation is made, as cash flow and capital requirements\npermit, the board of directors may direct the Co-operative to pay out in\ncash a fixed percentage of all member loans as they stand after the\nyear’s surplus allocations. The balance of the individual member’s\ncapital account shall be adjusted accordingly.\nWithin 3 months after the end of every financial year, the treasurer\nshall provide all members with a statement showing the amount of their\nloan accounts in the Co-operative.\n\n\n7.

The rate tasks are completed and their relative priorities are decisions by the group\nMentions mean you or your group is requested for input. The response time expectation is 2 working days, which means each member should check their Mentions at least that frequently, for their own GitHub handle and every GitHub Team they are part of\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignments\nMentions\n\n\n\n\nYou\nassignee:you\nmentions:you\n\n\nOrg Groups\n\n\nMember Workers\n\nteam:@hyphacoop/member-workers\n\n\nDirectors\n\nteam:@hyphacoop/directors\n\n\nWorking Groups\n\n\nBusiness Planning WG\nlabel:wg:business-planning\nteam:@hyphacoop/business-planning-wg\n\n\nFinance WG\nlabel:wg:finance\nteam:@hyphacoop/finance-wg\n\n\nGovernance WG\nlabel:wg:governance\nteam:@hyphacoop/governance-wg\n\n\nInfra & Ops WG\nlabel:wg:infra-ops\nteam:@hyphacoop/infra-ops-wg\n\n\nProject Groups\n\n\nAether PG\nlabel:proj:aether\n\n\n\nPrimal Glow PG\nlabel:proj:primal-glow\n\n\n\nNote that while most tasks show up as Issues from hyphacoop/organizing and hyphacoop/organizing-private, there will also be Issues from other repositories, and some items that require your attention will show up as Pull Requests. The above search filters will catch everything. It is recommended for members to bookmark the search filters that apply to them in their browser and check them everyday.\nMembers are encouraged to use emojis liberally to indicate they have, for example: &#x1F440; read the comment, &#x1F44D; agree or &#x1F44E; disagree with the comment, etc. This applies generally to all our tools.\nMaking Decisions\nOnce tasks are assigned to groups, the group is entrusted to make decisions on the task and make judgment on when it is necessary to consult the wider membership or request specific members for input. Larger group decisions are made either at an All-hands Call and captured in meeting notes or using voting tools in Loomio.\nWhen using Loomio to set up a vote using the Proposal or Poll tool, the recommended voting period is 5 to 7 days. Post the voting link on the associated GitHub issue and tag @hyphacoop/member-workers or applicable GitHub handles, since GitHub is the primary place that everyone is actively checking for notification.\nReal-time Chat\nWe use Matrix as real-time chat for day-to-day task discussions and pinging members for urgent requests.\nAll members are encouraged to install a Matrix client on their phone, and configure notifications for +hyphacoop:tomesh.net rooms to Mentions only. In messages, we refer to members by initials and only use handles when trying to trigger a notification to bring someone to a conversation (i.e., an urgent ping). There is otherwise no expectation that members will check the chat regularly, or catch up on backscrolls, therefore it is important to be intentional in bringing summaries of decisions made back into Issues in GitHub.\nShared Calendar\nWe have two shared Google Calendars:\n\nhyphacoop: Internal meetings and public events of interest\nhyphacoop: availability: Member office hours and member travels (as all-day events)\n\nMembers can use office hours to identify work hour overlaps with each other, where they can expect peers to be on chat and likely to be available for calls.

As part of that, we've developed a set of guidelines for how (and exactly what) and why we work in the open.\nWhy?\n\nIn order to share and provide opportunities for self- and collective- learning as we work in solidarity with others seeking to create meaningful livelihoods.\nNot because \"default to open\" is an ideal in itself, but because it orients us toward negotiating a set of practices around our shared intentions.\nYet we recognize openly sharing might prevent frank and necessary discussion beneficial to our members, and so we want to clearly lay out our practices of consent and privacy.\n\nHow and what?\n\nWe currently accommodate redactions and going off-the-record for meeting notes. Participants can request to stop taking notes, or redact and correct notes after they have been taken.\nWe recognize that some information should be treated as sensitive and confidential for the benefit of Hypha and its clients and collaborators.

Accounts\n\nFinancial institution: Desjardins\nAccount type: business chequing\nPayment requirements from account:\n: sign-off by one signing member in the Finance WG\n> CAD$200: sign-off by two signing members in the Finance WG\n\n\n\nHypha is expected to conduct business with clients from other countries and is ready to accept funds in CAD, USD, EUR, and GBP.\nWe use TransferWise to minimize transaction and currency exchange fees.\nOur TransferWise account has local accounts in Canada, United States, Europe, and the United Kingdom, so we can bill clients as a local financial institution in their local currency.\nOur TransferWise account does not require multiple signatures, and the Finance WG is responsible for transferring money into our main Desjardins account when accumulated funds exceed a CAD 10,000 threshold, or earlier as deemed appropriate.\nInvoicing Clients\nHypha charges clients on a sliding scale, and projects may be billed hourly, weekly, monthly, or per project, depending on the specifics of each project.\nThe recommended practice is to send an invoice every month, or a quote if the amount for the month is small and at the discretion of the project.\nIn cases where an invoice is not collected in time for payroll, or failed to be collected altogether, this is treated as a cost to the Co-operative and we strongly advocate that this not affect the timely payroll to the Member.\nIn order to create invoices and to collect payments, there are three general steps that need to be performed in order.\nGenerating Timesheets\nFor clients with billing models that require tracked work hours, Clockify is used to generate timesheets for determining the invoice amount each period, and often for calculating Member wages.\nThese timesheets are archived in our shared drive under the Timesheets directory and may be attached to invoices at client request.\nRefer to the guides for Timesheets to generate and archive your project timesheets.\nGenerating Invoices\nRefer to the guides for Invoices and generate an invoice in Quickbooks Online based on the project pricing structure (e.g. timesheet hours and project rate) and payment information.\nIn general, the client is responsible for paying applicable HST and transaction costs charged by their financial institution, and Hypha pays the cost of receiving the payment (e.g. cost of receiving a wire).\nInvoices are sent to clients and are preferably due 2 weeks after the invoice date (i.e. Net 15), after which a late fee may be charged for each additional week.\nSettling Payments\nAfter client payments are collected at our Desjardins or TransferWise accounts, we need to:\n\nMove money to the appropriate accounts at our financial institutions\nRecord exchange rates and transaction costs\nUpdate our bookkeeping records in Quickbooks Online\nFinalize and archive invoices\n\nRefer to the guides for Invoices to handle the settling of payments with someone from the Finance WG.\nMember Payroll\nMember wages are paid on the pay day, which is the 15th of each month or the last working day prior if the 15th happens to land on a holiday.\nA Member's wage is calculated based on the billable hours of work rendered up to the end of the previous month.\nFor example:\n\nThe March 15 pay day covers the \"pay period\" of February, and it pays for the work rendered throughout the month of February.\n\nBefore the 7th of each month, Members must submit payroll information to the Employee Payroll sheet in order to be paid for the pay period covering the previous month.\nAll wages, expense reimbursements, and withheld taxes are managed by the Payroll Coordinator using Wagepoint and Quickbooks Online, which are linked to our main Desjardins account.\nCalculating Member Wages\nEach Member's wage for a pay period is calculated based on the projects and roles they participate in, and it usually varies from month to month.\nPay from billable project work will have a percent-based portion (the \"clip\") deducted from it to fund administrative costs and collective programs of the Co-operative.\nCollective programs, current and prospective, include:\n\nVacation pay\nPublic holiday pay\nCPP & EI employer contributions\nMember health benefits (future)\nSolidarity projects fund (future)\nMember & co-op development fund (future)\nReserve fund (future)\nOther collective expenses of the Co-operative\n\nThe regular pay of a Member is calculated with:\nREGULAR_PAY = (1 - CLIP) * BILLED_AMOUNT (before transaction costs)\nThe clip is currently set at 35% and is the same across all projects over a period, but can be revised as necessary by consensus.\nIn addition to the regular pay, Members are entitled to:\n\n5% public holiday pay based on the regular pay amount\n4% vacation pay based on the regular + public holiday pay amount\nCPP & EI employer contributions\n\nThese annualized amounts are calculated and included for each pay period.\nYou can use the Wage Calculator to determine these amounts.\nAfter tax withholdings and other applicable deductions (e.g. CPP & EI employee contributions), the net amount is electronically transferred to the Member's bank account on pay day using Wagepoint.\nRefer to the guides for Payroll to set up the payroll run for each pay period.\nExpense Reimbursement\nMember expenses eligible for reimbursement should be submitted to the Expense Reimbursement sheet and receipts uploaded to Employee Expense Receipts in the same quarter they are incurred.\nReimbursements are paid out with wages on the next pay day, but do not appear on tax forms.\nFollow the guides for Expense Reimbursement to submit an eligible expense.\nPublic Holiday Pay\nHypha is closed on public holidays and Members recieve 5% annualized public holiday pay in their wages every pay period. \nIn the case where Member-workers work on holidays, they receive regular wages with \"substitute time off\" and there is no expectation of \"public holiday plus premium pay\", following the Employment Standards Act of Ontario. Wages for work performed on public holidays are calculated without \"premium pay\" because Members have significantly variable hours of work per period and a 5% annualized public holiday pay is included in Member wages in every pay period. Members are already adequately compensated for any \"substitute time off\" and set their own schedule. This strikes a balance between those who want the time off and those who want the flexibility to work on the day. \nReporting & Remitting Taxes\nHypha has the following program accounts with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA):\n\n☑️ RC0001 Corporate Income Tax (RC) is filed/reported and remitted/paid each tax year\n☑️ RP0001 Payroll Deduction (RP) is reported and paid each pay period\n☑️ RT0001 GST/HST (RT) is reported and paid each quarter\n\nCorporate Income Tax (RC)\nHypha is incorporated as a non-share capital worker co-operative under the Ontario Co-operative Corporations Act, and is organizationally a non-profit.\nFor income tax purposes, Hypha is a non-profit organization under the Canadian Income Tax Act.\nNet assets are put into funds restricted for a particular purpose in accordance with our organizational mission, and our balance sheets show zero retained earnings/profit.\nAt each fiscal year-end, set on June 30, the Finance WG works with our accountant and bookkeeper to file our annual corporation income tax return, even though we pay no corporate income tax as a non-profit organization.\nPayroll Deduction (RP)\nWage deductions and remittances are handled through Wagepoint on their non-accelerated remittance schedule.\nIf any pay period is skipped, a nil remittance is manually filed to CRA directly.\nAt the end of each year, Hypha issues a T4 to each employee and a T4A to each contractor to support personal income tax filings, and reports to CRA accordingly. This is also handled using Wagepoint.\nGST/HST (RT)\nThe GST/HST Information for Non-Profit Organizations applies to Hypha for GST/HST purposes.\nWe started collecting GST/HST as of May 15, 2020 with a quarterly reporting period and our fiscal year end date for GST/HST return on June 30.\nMuch of our digital services (e.g. software development, system administration, design) for international clients (outside of Canada) are GST/HST zero-rated as they are classified as exported goods and services.\nThis is different from GST/HST exempt because zero-rated items are still eligible for Input Tax Credit (ITC) on related expenditures.\nThis is described under Intangible personal property and Excise Tax Act section 10 of Part V of Schedule VI.\nWhether we will charge and claim GST/HST is dependent on a few factors.\nHere are some likely scenarios that may apply to Hypha projects:\n\nHypha provides IT consultation and software development service to a Canadian client and subcontracts a Canadian web developer, spends $100 on web hosting and $1,000 on a laptop to help us fulfill the contract.\n\nWe will charge 13% HST when invoicing the Canadian client\nThe Canadian subcontractor:\nif incorporated (e.g. a company), may charge us 13% HST when invoicing us, which we can reclaim as ITC\nif unincorporated (e.g. a person), has no GST/HST implications as we will add them to payroll and issue a T4A at the end of the year\n\n\nWe are eligible to reclaim the 13% HST of $100 paid to acquire web hosting as ITC\nWe are eligible to reclaim the 13% HST of $1,000 paid to acquire the laptop as ITC\n\ni. Same scenario, but the client is a non-Canadian company.\n\nWe will charge no HST when invoicing the client, and mark as zero-rated on the invoice since the service is considered intellectual property exports\nThe Canadian subcontractor may charge us 13% HST when invoicing us, which we can still reclaim as ITC\nWe are still eligible for all ITC claims as above\n\nii. Same scenario, but the subcontractor is a non-resident of Canada and the service is rendered outside the country.\n\nThe international subcontractor, incorporated or unincorporated, will charge us no GST/HST when invoicing us (Hypha can pay the invoice via TransferWise in a supported currency of their preference), there is no ITC claim on the payment\nWe are still eligible for all other ITC claims as above\n\niii. Same scenario, but the subcontractor is a non-resident of Canada and the service is rendered inside the country.\n\nHypha needs to open a non-resident tax withholding account with CRA and remit 25% of the gross payment as withholding tax, and handle applicable end of year filings\n\n\nHypha receives a grant from a private company to facilitate a free digital security workshop that is open to public, and spends $100 on materials.\n\nHST does not apply, and we do not need to collect or remit GST/HST on the grant amount\nThe $100 materials is not eligible as ITC because the grant is GST/HST exempt (different from zero-rated)\n\ni. Same scenario, but the workshop has a registration fee collected by the client, and is not open to public.\n\nWe need to charge 13% HST when invoicing the client, this is no longer a \"grant\"\nWe are eligible to reclaim the 13% HST of $100 materials as ITC\n\n\n\nIf none of these scenarios apply to your situation, and you are unsure whether to charge GST/HST on an invoice, or whether an expense is eligible as ITC, please reach out to the Finance WG.\nHolding crypto-currency\nHypha may sometimes need to hold cryptocurrencies. \n\nWe have a key holder role to manage our keys.\nWe have a Cosmos multisig treasury wallet &#x1F512;, a hot wallet, and various purpose-specific wallets listed in our account information &#x1F512;\n\n"},"fiscal-sponsorship.html":{"url":"fiscal-sponsorship.html","title":"Fiscal Sponsorship","keywords":"","body":"Fiscal Sponsorship\nHypha is a Canadian Fiscal Host on the Open Collective platform.

These are the terms of the relationship entered into between:\n\nHypha Worker Co-operative Inc. (Ontario Corporation No. 5019866) (\"Us\" or \"Hypha\"); and\nthe Collective, which has agreed to these terms and conditions (\"You\" or \"the Collective\").\nThis agreement (\"Agreement\") is entered into with effect from the date (\"Effective Date\") that you confirm, by ticking the relevant box, that you have read and agree to these terms and that Hypha has accepted your request to include your Collective as part of Hypha and provide support to You for the purposes you described in your application.\n\n\n\nRecitals. The parties enter into this Agreement with reference to the following facts:\n\nHypha is a non-share capital worker co-operative based in Toronto. We are a non-profit organization.\n\nHypha's mission is to cultivate collective growth and meaningful livelihoods through learning and building technologies together. We work in solidarity with our neighbours, where we support each other and provide safe harbour to imagine and create alternative futures (\"Hypha's Mission\").\n\nThe Collective, with its stated mission, meets the criteria for engaging Hypha as a fiscal sponsor as according to Exhibit A (\"Protocols\"). The Collective agrees to continue to align with Hypha's Mission in the future.\n\nThe Collective and Hypha mutually desire to enter a fiscal sponsorship relationship as according to the terms set out in this Agreement.\n\nThe parties agree that Hypha shall:\n\nreceive funds for the Collective (\"Funds\") to be held by Hypha; and\nafter discussing with You, control these funds for the use of the Collective (less any administrative charges, interest, and expenses).\n\n\n\n\nTerm. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date, and will continue unless and until terminated under clause 10 of this Agreement.\n\nRelationship. Nothing in this Agreement means that the Collective or its members and/or agents is an agent or legal representative of Hypha for any purpose whatsoever except as provided in this Agreement.\n\nProtocols. Hypha has established certain protocols set out in Exhibit A. This sets out how Hypha shall manage and operate and deal with any funds.\n Hypha will provide the Protocols to the Collective and may from time to time update the Protocols to assist Hypha in performing its obligations effectively.\n\nFunds. You may solicit unconditional gifts, contributions, sponsorships, and grants to Hypha for the purpose of the Collective, where the payer is not receiving any specific good or service in return.\n The Collective understands, acknowledges and agrees that Hypha is not a registered charity or donee organisation, and that such funds collected by Hypha for the Collective will not have donation tax receipts issued for them and will not entitle the giver to a donation tax credit or a tax deduction.\n If the Collective wishes to accept conditional payments, where the payer receives a specific good or service in return, you must provide notice in writing to Hypha so that we can ensure any applicable Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) or other taxes are applied.\n\nThird party agreements. If You want to enter into any agreement or obligation with a donor, sponsor, vendor or other third party, to provide or receive services beyond simply receiving a donor's financial contributions, you must first provide notice of the specific details to Us and obtain Hypha's prior written consent, as these agreements or obligations will legally be between Hypha and the third party.\n\nIntellectual property. Any and all tangible or intangible property, including intellectual property, such as copyrights of the Collective, belong to You. Furthermore, You represent that you have the power and right to advance the Collective. We acknowledge and agree that any trademarks, trade names, artwork, designs, logos, copy, and all other intellectual property  provided to Hypha by the Collective or its agents (for example, to be put on websites) belongs to the Collective and not to Us. For the avoidance of doubt, you should register ownership in the name of an individual associated with the Collective rather than in the name of Hypha.\n\nThe Collective. Hypha will receive funds earmarked for support of the Collective, and make disbursements for expenses incurred in furtherance of the Collective. Beginning on the Effective Date, Hypha will place all such revenues received by Hypha and identified with the Collective into an account to be used for the benefit of the Collective's mission as that mission periodically may be defined by the Collective with the approval of Hypha. Hypha will exercise full control over the Collective's financial administration, management, and disbursement of the Fund.\n For the avoidance of doubt, the parties note that all money will be reported as the income of Hypha, for both tax purposes and for purposes of Hypha's financial statements. Accordingly, Hypha is responsible for the processing and deposit in the Fund of all monies received for the Collective.\n We will consult together around any payments to be made out to cover expenses of the Collective as detailed in the Protocols.\n\nTermination. Either Hypha or the Collective may terminate this Agreement on 30 days' written notice to the other party.\nUpon a termination notice being given, the Collective will notify Hypha of how the funds will be dealt with, from the following three options:\n\nsubmit a request that the balance is paid out as a legitimate Collective expense (submitted and processed as per the Protocols);\ndonate the funds of the Collective to another Collective hosted by Hypha; or\nHypha will donate the funds to a Canadian registered charity.\n\nIf no notice is provided that elects one of these options by the Collective within the 30 days' written notice period, then the default is for the funds to be donated to a registered charity by Hypha (option 3).\nIn addition, if no member of the Collective has responded to a request for termination instructions by Hypha for a period of 12 months then the funds will automatically be donated to a registered charity by Hypha.\n\nNotice. Each notice under this Agreement shall be in writing and delivered personally or sent by post or email to the person at the address or email notified in writing from time to time.\nA notice is deemed to be received:\n\nif delivered personally, when delivered;\nif posted, five business days after posting; or\nif sent by email, when actually received.\n\n\nDisputes. Before taking any Court action, a party must use best efforts to resolve any dispute under, or in connection with, the Agreement through good faith negotiations.\nIf there is a dispute between the parties in relation to this Agreement, either party may give the other party notice of the dispute.\nWithin 10 business days of receipt of the notice of dispute, the parties shall meet (in person or online) to endeavour to resolve the dispute.\nIf the dispute is not resolved within 20 business days of receipt of the notice of the dispute, either party may by notice to the other party refer the dispute to mediation, which will take place in person or online, with each party paying half of the cost of the mediation.\nWhile any dispute remains unresolved, each party shall continue to perform this Agreement to the extent practicable, but without prejudice to their respective rights and remedies.\n\nLiabilities & indemnification. You are responsible for all activities of the Collective, including any financial or other liabilities, and you indemnify and hold harmless Hypha and its representatives from any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) resulting from your performance of your obligations contained in this Agreement.\nYou also indemnify Us from any loss or liability resulting from injury (including sickness, disease or loss of life) to any person, or damage to any property of any third party at or as a result of your activities or the Collective.\nYou also indemnity Us in relation to any claims from third parties that you have violated any intellectual property laws.\n\nForce majeure. Neither party is liable to the other for any failure to perform its obligations under the Agreement to the extent caused by force majeure (which are events beyond the reasonable control of the affected party, such as a pandemic or natural disaster), provided that the affected party:\n\nimmediately notifies the other party and provides full information about the force majeure;\nuses best efforts to overcome the force majeure; and\ncontinues to perform its obligations to the extent practicable.\n\nEach party must take reasonable steps to mitigate any loss or damage, cost or expense it may suffer or incur arising out of anything done or not done by the other party under or in connection with the Agreement.\n\nJurisdiction. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Ontario and Canada as they apply in Ontario.\n\nEntire agreement & modification. This Agreement supersedes any prior oral or written understandings or communications between the parties and constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be amended by Us from time to time by posting new versions of these terms on our website and notifying You. By continuing to use the services of Hypha you will confirm that you agree to the modified terms.\n\nMiscellaneous. If there is any inconsistency between these terms and any other document submitted by You or any other arrangement with Us, these terms prevail unless otherwise agreed by Us in writing.\nTo waive a right under this Agreement, that waiver must be in writing and signed by the waiving party.\nThe parties are independent, and this Agreement does not create any partnership, agency or employment relationship between them.\nIf any provision of these terms and conditions is held by any court to be illegal, void or unenforceable, such determination shall not impair the enforceability of the remaining provisions.\n\n\nExhibit A: Protocols\nThe following are the policies and processes of Hypha's fiscal sponsorship.\nCriteria: The Collective will provide evidence and Hypha will confirm that the Collective has met the criteria for engaging Hypha as a fiscal sponsor, being that the Collective has a mission that is value-aligned with Hypha's mission and carry out activities that create positive social impact.\nHypha fees and expenses: The Collective will be required to pay membership fees (\"Fees\") and cover any expenses Hypha incurred on the Collective's behalf as a result of this Agreement. The Collective is responsible to pay from the Fund the Fees that consist of:\n\n5% of all of the funds deposited into the Fund, regardless of source, for purposes of becoming a Collective of Hypha and maintaining such membership; or\nany specific amounts agreed between us in writing (due, for example, to there being a specific sum which we agree to look after for a specific fee); and\nall interest earned on the Fund which will be retained in Hypha's general fund.\n\nPayment processor expenses: In addition to the Fees, the Collective is responsible for any merchant account credit card processing expenses incurred by Hypha as a result of administration of the Fund, which are directly related to the Collective's purpose. Such expenses shall be pulled directly from the Fund by Hypha.\nPlatform: Upon execution of this Agreement, the Collective will be featured on Open Collective, an accounting and crowdfunding platform (the \"Platform\"), specifically on Hypha's page, which is owned by Hypha.\nHypha will set the Collective up on the Platform such that the Collective will have its own dedicated page that tracks, in total transparency, the funds that it raises and the expenses it incurs in relation to the Collective.\nThe Collective's page on the Platform will be linked to Hypha's Stripe account, PayPal account, TransferWise account, and bank account, so that Hypha has control over the funds received and disbursed under the Platform for purposes of the Collective. The Platform thus serves as a fundraising avenue for the Collective, enabling it to raise funds and be reimbursed for expenses incurred in relation to the Collective.\nThe Platform makes the revenue and expenses of the Collective available to the public through a transparent ledger.\nDisbursements: In order to receive a disbursement from the funds raised to cover expenses incurred in furtherance of the Collective, those seeking payment must submit receipts/invoices onto the Platform for review by the Hypha staff, via the \"Submit Expense\" feature on the Collective's page.\nUpon Hypha's receipt of receipts/invoices, it will review all documentation to ensure the expenses incurred are valid. Upon approval by the Hypha staff, Hypha will reimburse those expenses to the payee through the Platform using PayPal, TransferWise, bank transfer, or another mutually agreed payment option. Each time Hypha reimburses the Collective for such expenses, the funds allocated to the Collective on the Platform will automatically decrease by the amount reimbursed.\nFunds received & expenses paid outside platform: In the event that the Collective receives funding outside of the Platform (that which does not go automatically and directly into the Fund), Hypha will use a feature enabled on the Platform to 'Manually Add Funds' to the Collective's balance. This means that Hypha will assign the funds received in the Fund destined to the Collective, thus increasing its budget. In the same fashion, if an expense is paid outside of the Platform by the Collective, because, for example, the recipient does not hold a PayPal account or another payout method is required, then Hypha will use the 'Mark as Paid' feature on the Platform, which allows Hypha to record that an expense has already been paid through a different method and that amount is automatically deducted from the Collective's Fund balance.\nThis page was last updated on November 11, 2020.

The squad has expertise in drafting client and grant project proposals, and managing the proposal process, so it is helpful to involve members of that group from the drafting stage. All  involved in the proposal drafting make up the initiative squad that will sign off on the final draft to be submitted.\nIf a proposal is accepted, this squad will lead the initial consultation meetings with the client (e.g. discuss terms of payment and project logistics), draft and sign a Client Agreement (see template). If a proposal fails, we encourage reaching out to the client or grant committee for feedback and holding an internal retrospective.\nRegardless whether the proposal is successful,\nthe squad should add a copy to the correct place: initiatives private archive &#x1F512; or public archive &#x1F513; for future reference.\nLaunching an Initiative\nOnce an initative has been approved, the lead should complete the following tasks:\n\nAdd a copy of the initiative proposal to the correct initiatives archive: private &#x1F512; or public &#x1F513;\nEnsure the initiative tracking sheet is correct, has the lead and involved people listed and an estimate of hours (should be all there from quarterly meeting)\nCreate a clockify project for time-tracking convos around it\n\nWrapping up an Initiative\nOnce an initiative has concluded, is it the responsibility of the lead to ensure the following tasks are completed:\n\nClose out tasks on task boards; remove meetings from the shared calendar; remove from list of active initiatives in the handbook and tracking sheet\nPrepare a brief update for the next quarterly planning session to discuss whether the goal was accomplished and the work was done\nDelieve that share-back at the appropropriate all hands / planning session\n\nInvoices\nPrior to creating an invoice, confirm with the client whether they would like to pay in CAD, USD, EUR, or GBP, and in what country their financial institution is based, then proceed with the following steps.\nCreating an invoice for a client\n\nGo to Quickbooks Online, open the Invoicing > Customers tab.\n\nIf the client is not in the customer list, click New customer to create a new profile for the client.\n\nClick Create invoice on the client you wish to invoice, and use the following settings:\n\nCc.: finance@hypha.coop\nTerms: Net 15 (may vary by project)\nMessage on invoice: [Payment instructions] (e.g. Please pay USD 3,135.00)\nAttachments: [Timesheet PDFs]\n\n\nAt the bottom of the page, click Customize to select a style, or create a new style template as needed.\n\nIf creating a new style template or the payment information needs to be changed, select the Content tab, click on the bottom section of the template preview to reveal the Add payment details and footer section, then enter the applicable payment information.\n For example:\n PAYMENT\n\n By ACH or domestic wire transfer to:\n\n ACH Transfer No. (ABA): 026073150\n Wire Transfer No. (ABA): 026073008\n Account No.: [REDACTED]\n Beneficiary Name: Hypha Worker Co-operative Inc.\n Beneficiary Address:\n\n     TransferWise\n     19 W 24th Street\n     New York\n     10010\n     United States\n\n Invoice amount will be adjusted to reflect actual exchange rate after payment.\n This is an invoice for a client based in the United States, payable in USD to our TransferWise account.\n Look at a previous invoice for examples.\n Review the invoice preview, then click Done.\n\nFill in the line items and calculate totals.\n See example below.\n All invoices are in CAD, even if the customer is paying in a foreign currency. This means RATE and AMOUNT columns are in CAD, and if the contract is an hourly rate based on a foreign currency, you can include the information in the DESCRIPTION column, and use an estimated CAD equivalent in the RATE column and to calculate the AMOUNT.\n\nIn the SALES TAX column, select one of HST ON, zero-rated, exempt, or out of scope for each line item.\n See example below.\n\nReview the invoice preview, then click Save and send to email the invoice to the client.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\nQTY\nRATE\nAMOUNT\nSALES TAX\n\n\n\n\nSoftware development for Jan 2020(52.25 @ USD 60.00 = 3,135.00)\n52.25\n80.00\n4,180.00\nzero-rated\n\n\nSoftware development for Feb 2020(20.00 @ USD 60.00 = 1,200.00)\n20.00\n80.00\n1,600.00\nzero-rated\n\n\n\nSettling an invoice payment\nOnce the client has paid the invoice, we must check the amount received at our receiving account at Desjardins (domestic) or TransferWise (foreign currency), and record the transaction in Quickbooks Online.\nDomestic\n\nAfter the money arrives to Desjardins, we need to update our records in Quickbooks Online:\n\nIn the Banking tab, select our Chequing account and click Update to sync our Desjardins account.\n\nFind the transaction from the client and click on it, then select Find match to select the incoming transaction to match.\n\nIf there is a discrepancy in the amounts, click the Resolve button and change CATEGORY to Bank charges, and GST/HST to Exempt (0%) since bank charges are exempt items, then click Save.\n\n\n\nArchive the PDF of the paid and finalized invoice in our shared drive under the Invoices directory with filename xxxx-project.pdf, where xxxx is the invoice number (e.g. 1001-aether.pdf).\n\n\nForeign Currency\n\nConfirm the correct amount is received, then convert the foreign currency to CAD.\nWe can either move the money to the CAD balance in TransferWise, or if the amount is large, we can directly deposit the exchanged amount into our Desjardins account.\nThe following example shows how to do that in a single transaction from TransferWise:\n\nConfirm that the invoice amount of 3,757.50 USD is received to our USD balance, then click Send USD.\n\n\n\nChoose My business and enter in our Desjardins account information for the deposit.\n\n\n\nNote the invoice number in the Reference field, then click Confirm and send.\n\nIn this example, a client in the United States sent 3,757.50 USD to the Hypha USD account at TransferWise, and we deposited 4,904.11 CAD at the Hypha CAD account at Desjardins.\nThe transaction and exchange fee was 20.61 USD, and the exchange rate was 1.31235.\nIf invoice amounts are small, we may batch many of them in TransferWise before depositing to Desjardins, but we should still convert foreign currencies to CAD as soon as possible and hold the amount as CAD in our TransferWise CAD balance.\n\nIn the USD balance, click on Download a statement and download a CSV file for the date range that includes the transaction(s).\nOpen the file and multiply the amounts with the exchange rate column, then save.\n\n\n\nAfter the money arrives to Desjardins, we need to update our records in Quickbooks Online:\n\nClick on the invoice and add a line item that accommodates for the discrepancy in estimated and actual exchange rates.\n In our example where we deposited 4,904.11 CAD to Desjardins, if our invoice estimated a CAD AMOUNT of 4,950.00 CAD, we would record an Exchange rate adjustment @ 1.31235 line item with -45.89 as AMOUNT.\n Make sure you take the exchange rate from the TransferWise CSV.\n\nIn the Banking tab, select our Chequing account and click Update to sync our Desjardins account.\n Find the transaction from TransferWise and click on it, and change the Category to TransferWise, change Tax code to Out of Scope (Sales) since this is an internal transfer, then click Add.\n\nIn the Banking tab, select our TransferWise account to click File upload (down arrow next to Update) to update our TransferWise account.\n Browse and upload the TransferWise CSV we saved earlier, select TransferWise as the account, then click Next and enter the following:\n\nDate: Column 2\nDescription: Column 5\nAmount: Column 3\n\nClick Next twice, and then Yes to import.\n\nFind the transaction from the client and click on it, then select Find match to select the incoming transaction to match.\n There should be no discrepancy in the amounts.\n\nFind the transaction from our TransferWise account to Desjardins account, then select Find match.\n We expect a discrepancy in the amounts.\n Click the Resolve button and change CATEGORY to Bank charges, then click Save.\n\nIf there is a discrepancy, click the Resolve button and change CATEGORY to Bank charges, and GST/HST to Exempt (0%) since bank charges are exempt items, then click Save.\n\n\n\nArchive the PDF of the paid and finalized invoice in our shared drive under the Invoices directory with filename xxxx-project.pdf, where xxxx is the invoice number (e.g. 1001-aether.pdf).\n\n\nIssue Labels\nWe have specific GitHub repos (known as synced repos throughout this guide) configured to mirror all labels from the root hyphacoop/organizing,\non each change to the root repo's labels.\nThough some of the below steps are more complicated than we'd ideally like,\nthis is because the automation is cautious and won't delete any in-use labels (regardless of open/closed state),\nso nothing destructive will happen.\nTo manage the list of synced repos (e.g., ensuring a new repo starts having labels synced),\nadd a new entry to LABEL_REPO_TARGETS in this configuration file and ensure @hyphacoop-bot has write-access to each synced repo.\nTo create a new label, just add it to the hyphacoop/organizing repo,\nand it will be added to others within a few minutes.\n(Sync events are logged in this issue as new comments for troubleshooting.)\nTo delete an existing label, search for the label you'd like to delete,\nlike so.\nOur automation is cautious, and so will only delete labels from repos where it's NOT in use.\nFor any repos represented in the search results, delete the label from that repo.\nOnce no labelled issues show up, delete the label from hyphacoop/organizing,\nand anything else will be cleaned up. If you leave any issues labelled,\nthe automation will simply do cleanup on its next run.\nAs soon as a label is unused in a repo, the automation will remove it on the next run.\nTo rename an existing label (this one's a bit tricky),\nsearch for the label you'd like to rename,\nlike so.\nIgnore hyphacoop/organizing for now, we'll save it for last.\nFor every other repo where it's used, click the \"repo\" link,\nand visit the label page to manually rename.\nLastly, rename the label in hyphacoop/organizing,\nand it will ensure the label is removed in any repos where it wasn't in-use.\n(Renaming is understood by the automation as a newly created label and a deleted label.)\nTo force a label sync, assuming you're impatient for it to do clean-up of unsued labels,\nslightly change a description or color of a label in hyphacoop/organizing.\nMeetings\nScheduling a meeting\nNote: Consider whether this meeting might be a global interest to other\nmembers.

Deadlines for submitting HST to the CRA is at the end of the following month after the end of each quarter is completed. This means end of April, July, October and January. The process has three parts. Preparing the HST (this is done by the bookkeeper), filing the HST with CRA and if required payment of the amount owed.\nPreparing HST\nThe bookkeeper will prepare the HST reporting shortly after each quarter is over. They will send an e-mail to the Finance WG that looks like this:\nPlease file and pay the HST as per following lines:\n\nLine 101 : 10,000.00\nLine 105: 2,000.00\nLine 108: 1,000.00\n\n109-NET TAX 1000-will be automatically calculated\n115- Amount Owing 1000- will be automatically calculated\nThis will trigger Finance to take action.\nFiling HST\nTo Filing the HST you will need to access the CRA's GST/HST NETFILE website. The website and all relative identifying information can be found in Passbolt.\n\nVisit the GST/HST NETFILE website\nPress the Ready to file button\nPress the Continue button at the bottom of the page\nEnter the Business Number from Passbolt.

The payment must be confirmed by the 2nd person within 48 hours.\n\nLogin to Desjardins\nSelect the Payments button on the right, a pulldown menu will appear\nSelect Government remittances - Can-Act\nSelect Confirm on the popup\nSelect Federal - GST/HST\nSelect Pay at the top bar\nEnter last day of the quarter as Period Ending\nEnter amount from Line 115 as Amount owing\nConfirm right amount displays in Total payment field\nSelect Next\nConfirm values are correct\nSelect Submit\nConfirm message The transaction is now in Pending Approval status and requires 1 approver(s). Displays at the top\nClick Done\n\nInitiatives\nSetting up an Initiative\nAn initiative proposal should be brief and provide and overview and argument and use the template. You can add more sections as appropriate, including sample code, project roadmap, etc. Examples can be found in our initives archive &#x1F512;.\nOnce a proposal has been drafted and approved, the squad will set up a new initiative with support from the Operations squad\nLeads, Opportunities & Client Proposals\nWhile the Opportunities squad is mainly in charge of sales lead generation,\nall members may pursue leads as they come up.\nMembers are strongly encouraged to record leads into the co-operative's leads tracking system whether or not we want to pursue this lead.\nIf a member decides to pursue a lead,\nthey can reach out to gauge potential interest in working together.\nIf the lead expresses intention to proceed with a concrete project in mind,\nthis becomes an opportunity.\nThe member now heads up this sales effort and drafts an Initiative Proposal with support from the Opportunities squad, then present it (e.g., at a meeting, or via virtual channels) to see whether the co-operative wants to move forward.\nIn this meeting, we should discuss any concerns by other members,\nand gauge team capacity given project timelines.\nAn initiative proposal should be brief and provide and overview and argument and use the template for setting up an initiative.\nDrafting and Submission\nProposals to be submitted to a potential client or grant committee should be drafted by members who will participate in the project with support from the Opportunities squad. The squad has expertise in drafting client and grant project proposals, and managing the proposal process, so it is helpful to involve members of that group from the drafting stage. All  involved in the proposal drafting make up the initiative squad that will sign off on the final draft to be submitted.\nIf a proposal is accepted, this squad will lead the initial consultation meetings with the client (e.g. discuss terms of payment and project logistics), draft and sign a Client Agreement (see template). If a proposal fails, we encourage reaching out to the client or grant committee for feedback and holding an internal retrospective.\nRegardless whether the proposal is successful,\nthe squad should add a copy to the folder in our shared drive for future reference.\nSensitive Data\nIn general, most members prefer not to use third-party SaaS services, like Google Drive, for storing sensitive information.\nWe store short strings (like SINs or codes) as password entries in Passbolt. These entries should be shared with both a privileged group that needs access (e.g., Finance WG) and the individual.\nIf we must store sensitive docs (like PDFs) in a shared drive for convenience (e.g., Google Drive),\nwe first encrypt them with a password.\nWe keep this in Passbolt under the entry Shared Drive: Encrypted Files.\nAll employees can access this password.\nSimpler encryption schemes are preferred, for example, default PDF encryption.\nWe recommend any secured file.pdf be renamed to file.encrypted.pdf for easy discovery.\nAs a last resort for sensitive docs, a member can choose to have the document printed and stored in a folder in the office.\nSignatures\nSigning internal documents\nThe Board of Directors uses PGP signatures to digitally sign resolutions.\nWe recommend using the GnuPG command line, but you can also use the Keybase command line, to sign and verify resolutions.\n\nSigning with GnuPG:\n  $ gpg --sign --armor \\\n    --output resolution-001.md.github_handle.asc \\\n    resolution-001.md\n  with Keybase:\n  $ keybase pgp sign \\\n    --infile resolution-001.md \\\n    --outfile resolution-001.md.github_handle.asc\n\nVerifying with GnuPG:\n  $ gpg --verify resolution-001.md.github_handle.asc\n  with Keybase:\n  $ keybase pgp verify \\\n    --infile resolution-001.md.github_handle.asc\n\n\nThe text of the signed document is embedded in the signature file, so you can drop any signature file resolution-XXX.md.github_handle.asc into keybase.io/verify to verify a signature.\nFor example, you can try verifying resolution-001.md.benhylau.asc.\nNote: for submitting resolutions to the Government, you will need to use an additional signing process as if resolutions are external documents. Previously this was achieved by using pandoc to build a PDF package with the resolution (without including PGP signatures) and entering that to HelloSign (see organizing/#385 for context).\nSigning external documents\nMembers also use other tools such as HelloSign for signing client-facing documents. \nSee this related GitHub issue for an example of prior usage.\nShortlinks\nManaging shortlinks\nWe use a custom shortlink service at link.hypha.coop. It helps us:\n\nresolve keywords to URLs from any computer,\nmake commonly used resources quickly and easily accessible,\nsimplify link-sharing in spoken conversations, and\nalign on shorthand keywords for resources.\n\nInstructions on creating and managing shortlinks are available in\nour configuration repo under hyphacoop/shortlinks directory.\nAccessing shortlinks\n\nHint: You can use a URL hash to deep-link into an expanded shortlink.\nExample: http://link.hypha.coop/inventory#LinkedIn\n\nShortlinks work on their own in the address bar, but for even easier access on your own\nworkstation, you can add a \"custom search engine\" keyword to your\nbrowser.\nThis allows you to type something like hshortlinks into the\nsearch bar, and get https://link.hypha.coop/shortlinks\nHere's a screencast of how it works on Chrome:\n\nInstructions:\nChrome\n| Firefox (requires extension)\nTimesheets\nMembers log their work hours using Clockify, and project timesheets may be generated to determine the invoice amount each period for some clients, and often for calculating member wages.\nThis process is done using the Clockify Summary Report.\nShared reports are found under Shared Reports.\nSetting up a new project\nWhen a project begins, generate a Summary Report for the project:\n\nSelect the appropriate Client (and/or Project) and Billing filters\n\n\nConfigure the table headings to Group by: Project > User > Description\n\nClick the share button to reveal the Share report dialog\n\n\nName the report project_YYYYMM where YYYYMM indicates the first month the project is active, leave the Lock dates unlocked, and select the appropriate Visibility for the project\n\nYou can now find the link to your project under Shared Reports\n\n\nGenerating project timesheets\n\nTo generate timesheets, open the Shared Report for your project (e.g. meetcoop_202005) and export as PDF for the applicable report period (to be sent to client, if applicable)\n\nTimesheet PDFs sent to clients or for internal payroll calculation should be archived in our shared drive under the Timesheets directory\n\n\nVirtual Machines\nWe use Proxmox to run our VMs. To access the management interface you need to SSH tunnel to kvm1.hypha.coop on port 34634 or connect over the VPN.\nProxmox\nProxmox is the hypervisor that all the virtual machines run on. There are two ways of accessing the Proxmox servers management interface. An inventory of machines running on this server can be found in the inventory-private repo.\n\nSSH tunnel\n\nTunnel the web interface over SSH with ssh root@kvm1.hypha.coop -p 34634 -L 8006:127.0.0.1:8006\nAccess the panel using https://127.0.0.1:8006\nThe username is root and enter the password in our shared password manager Passbolt\n\n\nVPN (Recommended)\n\nConnect to OpenVPN (If you do not already have access please ping someone in the infra for the OpenVPN config file.)\nAccess the panel using https://kvm1.hypha.coop:8006\nThe username is root and enter the password in our shared password manager Passbolt\n\n\n\nJump server\nTo be able to ssh into the different virtual machines running on the infrastructure, authentication must be done via the jump server. This means you must first login to the jump server with your ssh key, and once there, you can use the keys on the jump server to connect and authenticate to the other virtual machines.\n\nConnecting to staging Ansible1 (Our provisioning and jump server for staging machines)\nBy default all members access to the production environment\n\nYou'll need to ensure that your key has been added. You can do that by making a PR here.\nssh sysadmin@ansible1.hypha.stg -p 8002 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa (assuming ~/.ssh/id_rsa is your key you use to access Hypha's infra.)\nFrom there you can SSH into the backend systems using their .stg hostnames or directly with their IP address. The passphase for ~/.ssh/id_rsa is here\n\n\nConnecting to production Ansible1 (Our provisioning and jump server for production machines)\nBy default only members that have a need to access have permissions to log in to the production environment\n\nYou'll need to ensure that your key has been added. You can do that by making a PR here.\nssh sysadmin@ansible1.hypha.prod -p 9154 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa (assuming ~/.ssh/id_rsa is your key you use to access Hypha's infra.)\nFrom there you can SSH into the backend systems using their .prod hostnames or directly with their IP address. The passphase for ~/.ssh/id_rsa is here\n\n\n\nAlternatively by adding a host profile for each hostname to ~/.ssh/config.  Doing this, when you ssh to the hostname specified, it will automatically jump you through the jump server, and into the target server. Example of a profile that uses the ansible's keys below.\nHost [[hostname]]\n  RemoteCommand ssh %n\n  HostName ansible1.hypha.prod\n  User sysadmin\n  Port 9154\n  RequestTTY yes\nVoicemail\nAccessing Voicemail\nWe use a VoIP phone line provider with forwarding and voicemail from voip.ms.

We occasionally use the analytics tools provided by these platforms.\nOur social media accounts include:\n\n  @hyphacoop on Twitter (privacy policy)\n  Hypha Worker Co-operative on LinkedIn (privacy policy)\n\n\nWe also use third-party services to host and deliver services and content, almost exclusively to our members, however in some cases we may use them with our collaborators:\n\nEmail services by A Series of Tubez Networks\nMatrix chat services by Toronto Mesh\n\nFor a full list of services we use, please refer to our Services Inventory.\n"},"reading-pool.html":{"url":"reading-pool.html","title":"Reading Pool","keywords":"","body":"Reading Pool\nLegend  \n&#x1F509; Audio clips :speaker:&#x1F4DA; Books :books:&#x1F4C4; PDF reports or articles :page_facing_up:&#x1F3AC; Videos :clapper:&#x1F310; Web sites or online resources :globe_with_meridians:    \n\n7 International Co-operative Principles:\n\n&#x1F310; ICA Cooperative identity, values & principles\n&#x1F310; ICA Guidance Notes to the Co-operative Principles\n&#x1F310; Willy Street Seven Cooperative Principles\n&#x1F310; Grassroots Economic Organizing: The Cooperative Principles, the Common Good, and Solidarity\n\nTech Worker Co-ops:\n\n&#x1F4C4; A technology freelancer's guide to starting a worker's coop\n&#x1F509; Soundcloud Podcast: Worker Cooperatives: Widening Spheres of Democracy\n&#x1F310; Tech Worker Co-op Repo: Incredible list of resources including a db of active tech co-ops worldwide\n&#x1F310; Vibes Theory of Organization Design - Enspiral\nidentifies lots of tensions while building organizational culture\n\n\n&#x1F310; Enspiral Handbook\n* Important People Agreement**\nResource Git for Beginners\nRelated Root Systems \"Pod\"\n\n\n&#x1F310; Lab.coop Reading List\n&#x1F4C4; Balancing Performance with Principles in Coops and Mutuals, Report by Ernst and Young\n\nCivics, Tech, Politics:\n\n&#x1F310; Paul Frazee \"Information Civics\" (Wayback Machine, Github)\n&#x1F4C4; Langdon Winner \"Do Artifacts have Politics\"\n&#x1F310; Diana Nucera \"Two-way Streets: Forging the Paths Towards Participatory Civic Technology\"\n&#x1F310; Design Justice Principles\n&#x1F310; From \"Openness\" to Justice\n&#x1F4C4; Indigenous Cooperatives in Canada: The Complex Relationship Between Cooperatives, Community Economic Development, Colonization, and Culture\n\nCollaboration, Methodologies:\n\n&#x1F310; Study Collaboration\nThinking about novel ways of collaborating between us and others\nAlso, neat links towards the bottom\n\n\n&#x1F310; Patterns for Decentralised Organising\n&#x1F310; Designing Methodologies 2018, Shannon Mattern\n&#x1F310; Aspiration Tech Facilication Resources\n&#x1F310; Beautiful Trouble: A Toolbox for Revolution\n&#x1F4DA; adrienne maree brown (2017) Emergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds\n&#x1F310; Loconomics Cooperative Bylaws\n&#x1F310; Waag Co-creation Toolkit\n&#x1F310; El LleialTec: Pla de Sobirania Tecnològica als equipaments municipals (Google translated)\n\nNew Economies:\n\n&#x1F310; Center for Global Justice: Solidarity Economy Directory\n&#x1F310; The Future of Social Economy Leadership and Organizational Composition in Canada: Demand from Demographics, and Difference through Diversity\n\nCommons, Anti-capitalism:\n\n&#x1F4DA; Elinor Ostrom (1990) Governing the Commons\n&#x1F310; 8 principles for designing common pool resources\n\n\n&#x1F4C4; JK Gibson-Graham, J Cameron, & S Healy (2016) \"Commoning as a postcapitalist politics\" In Releasing the Commons: Rethinking the futures of the commons\n&#x1F4C4; G Caffentzis, S Frederici (2014) \"Commons against and beyond capitalism\"\n&#x1F4C4; S Frederici (2011) \"Feminism and the politics of the commons\"\n&#x1F4C4; Yochai Benkler Commons-Based Peer Production and Virtue\n&#x1F4C4; Stavros Stavrides Common Space: The City as Commons\n&#x1F3AC; Richard Sennett The Decline of the Skills Society\n&#x1F310; Scott Alexander Meditations On Moloch (link removed, see explanation)\n\nWhy Decentralize?\n\n&#x1F3AC; Sarah Friend Decentralization and Its Discontents at Radical Networks 2018\n&#x1F4C4; Nathan Schnieder n.d. \"Decentralization: An Incomplete Ideology\"\n&#x1F310; Data Together Reading List or Zotero Group\n\nRequirements for co-ops in Canada (Federal and Provincial) (for more see 2018 retreat playbook):\n\n&#x1F4C4; Ontario.coop fact sheets\n&#x1F310; Industry Canada Starting a Federal co-op\n&#x1F310; Industry Canada Starting an ON co-op\n&#x1F310; Ontario.coop Starting a co-operative\n\n"},"glossary.html":{"url":"glossary.html","title":"Glossary","keywords":"","body":"Glossary\nAKA the thing that no one ever reads.
