In the tradition of their founders, \ncooperative members believe in the ethical values of honesty, openness, \nsocial responsibility and caring for others.\nSeven Principles\n\nVoluntary and Open MembershipCooperatives are voluntary organisations, \nopen to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, \nwithout gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination.\nDemocratic Member ControlCooperatives are democratic organisations controlled by their members, \nwho actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. \nMen and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. \nIn primary cooperatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) \nand cooperatives at other levels are also organised in a democratic manner.\nMember Economic ParticipationMembers contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their cooperative. \nAt least part of that capital is usually the common property of the cooperative. \nMembers usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of membership. \nMembers allocate surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: developing their cooperative, \npossibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible; \nbenefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the cooperative; \nand supporting other activities approved by the membership.\nAutonomy and IndependenceCooperatives are autonomous, self-help organisations controlled by their members. \nIf they enter into agreements with other organisations, including governments, \nor raise capital from external sources, \nthey do so on terms that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their cooperative autonomy.\nEducation, Training, and InformationCooperatives provide education and training for their members, elected representatives, \nmanagers, and employees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their co-operatives. \nThey inform the general public - particularly young people and opinion leaders - about the nature and benefits of co-operation.\nCooperation among CooperativesCooperatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the cooperative movement by working together through local, \nnational, regional and international structures.\nConcern for CommunityCooperatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members.\n\n\n"},"bylaws.html":{"url":"bylaws.html","title":"Bylaws","keywords":"","body":"Bylaws\nBylaws adopted: June 13, 2020\n1.

SURPLUS, LOSS AND INTERNAL CAPITAL ACCOUNTS\n\nDefinitions\nThe net worth is the difference between the assets and liabilities of\nthe Co-operative‚Äôs books, kept according to generally accepted\naccounting principles. Where liabilities exceed assets, the net worth is\nnegative.\nThe internal capital accounts reflect the allocation of the net worth\nof the Co-operative among individual members‚Äô capital accounts and the\nreserves. The sum of the balances in the internal capital accounts is\nthe net worth of the Co-operative.\nAn individual member‚Äôs capital account records the part of the net\nworth contributed by and credited to each member through direct\ninvestment by the member in the form of member loans and by the\ninvestment of patronage returns determined by the member‚Äôs share of\nlabour patronage described in section 6.1.\nThe reserve is the collective portion of the net worth that is not to\nbe returned to the individual members. An indivisible reserve is never\ndivided among members, it is permanent co-operative capital that\nrepresents the value of the common effort of the members. The\nindivisible reserve is like any other retained earnings and controlled\nby members while the Co-operative is operating however they will not be\navailable to the individual members if the Co-operative ceases to exist.\nThe net income is the book net income for the financial year, after\ninterest on member loans and special allocations, computed in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe surplus or loss with respect to a financial year of the\nCo-operative is:\nI.  the book net income or loss for the financial year;  \nII. less tax payable on the net income of the Co-operative;  \nIII. plus the amount of tax on the income of the Co-operative   recoverable owing to a loss for that financial year;\nIV. all as computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting\n   principles consistently applied and after payment or recovery of\n   income tax on the Co-operative‚Äôs income. If the total is positive,\n   it is a surplus. If the total is negative, it is a loss.\nThe labour patronage of a member is the total hours worked for the\nCo-operative during the financial year regardless of the rate of pay.\nWork performed while a probationary member or a casual worker shall not\nbe included in the calculation of labour patronage. A minimum of 16\nhours must be contributed by the member in any year before labour\npatronage will be calculated.\nThe member‚Äôs share of labour patronage is the individual‚Äôs labour\npatronage divided by the total labour patronage of all members.\nThe patronage return is the amount that is allocated, credited or paid\nin each fiscal year to members based on the business done by them with\nor through the Co-operative.\n\nMember Loans ‚Äì The Co-operative may hold loans from its members.\nThese loans may result from:\nA.  mandatory deductions from wages paid by the Co-operative, as may be\n   required by and at a rate set by the board of directors;B.  the retention of interest paid on an individual member‚Äôs loans;C.  the retention of an individual member‚Äôs portion of net income; orD.  voluntary loans made by the member to the Co-operative.  \nInterest rates paid on member loans shall be the lesser of: the\nprescribed maximum annual percentage of 2% above the prime rate\nestablished by the Bank of Canada on the first day of the month before\nthe month in which the rate of interest is set, or an annual percentage\ndetermined by the board of directors.\n\nReserves ‚Äì The reserve funds are held in a general reserve\naccount and consist of the collective portion of the net worth that\nis not returned to the members based on the allocation as defined in\nsection 6.4.

Worker-members, employees and other  participants and collaborators are encouraged to invoke the Code of Conduct at a level appropriate to the offense, e.g. a 1:1 conversation expressing concern may be appropriate in some scenarios, immediate banning may be appropriate in others, and other scales of intervention might suit in-between situations. \nIf you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a worker-member or employee immediately.

Members are expected to acknowledge the duties of their relationship with Hypha by signing the Membership Acknowledgement.\nBeing a Good Member\nAt our 2020 AGM we began the process of defining what it means to be a good member, we came up with the following initial description:\nIn order to be a good member, we commit to:\n\nfollowing Hypha‚Äôs Code of Conduct and Conflict Transformation processes\nbeing accountable to others, doing the work you've committed to, and coming prepared to all initiatives and meetings\nmaking time to learn and grow through co-working and peer sessions\nactively soliciting and providing feedback as you work on specific tasks\ntaking initiative to better yourself and Hypha\nsetting a high standard for the work you produce\ncultivating a healthy, collaborative environment, which means celebrating the accomplishments of your team and supporting each other through failure\n\nOur understanding was shaped from the following prompts and examples:\n\nPrompts:\nHow do you feel accomplished or that you have completed a task?\nWhat are the things you do before you come to a meeting?\nWhat do you need to (effectively) make a decision together?\nWhen do you feel like you've collaborated with hypha members well, what did you do?\n\n\nWhat our member statement is / isn't:\nIS:\nSkill-based, looking at individual capacities\n\"We\" and \"us\"-focused (i.e., \"I think this will help us work better together\")\n\n\nISN'T:\nList of working group or initiative responsibilities\nManagerial (\"I think that others need to do...\")\n\n\n\n\nExamples:\nSelf-Management is the art of autonomously recognizing what needs to be done, combined with the initiative to work cooperatively, in order to best meeting the collective needs of yourself and the cooperative.\n\nCasa Nueva\nCareful listening, summarizing and synthesis help us reach a good knowledge and understanding of what everyone needs, and find solutions everyone can accept. Put simply:\ngood listening enables us to hear what others are saying;\nsummaries help remind us of the key points in the discussion and check we have the same understanding;\nsynthesis is the skill that allows us to draw together different views and ideas to form one proposal that works for everyone.\nSeeds for Change \"Skills for Consensus\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers and Employees\nEvery member is both a member and an employee of Hypha, \nhowever there is a distinction between member duties and employee work.\nOur bylaws do not allow for members to be contractors and we do not employ dependent contractors.\nEmployees, as well as contractors and collaborators engaged in certain initiatives with Hypha,\nare expected to sign an Employee and Contractor Intellectual Property Agreement and comply with\ntax obligations as applicable to them.\nA member:\n\nHas completed a membership application (and/or been officially welcomed into \nthe membership)\nIs a founding, or permanent, member if they are one of the seven members who founded Hypha\nIs considered:\nactive if they have not requested to change their status\ninactive if they have requested to change their status\nInactive members are unable to vote, serve as a director, participate in \nprojects, or work as an employee for so long as they remain so\nInactive members can request to become active at any time\n\n\n\n\n\nAn employee: \n\nWorks as an employee under a contract of service with Hypha, see the CWCF's \"Guidelines for Determining Whether or Not There Is an Employer-Employee Relationship in a worker Co-op\" for clarification\nIs \"someone who performs work for an employer for wages,\" meeting the \nEmployment Standards Act, 2000 definition of employee \nIs considered permanent if they:\nHave completed a probationary period of one year \nAre not working under contract\n\n\n\nIn addition, people may had additional relationships with Hypha:\nA contractor:\n\nWorks as an independent contractor under a contract for service with Hypha\nProvides services clearly specified in a time-limited contractor agreement\nMay be a natural person or incorporated entity, domestic or foreign\n\nA collaborator:\n\nParticipates in open Hypha activities and projects without a formal employment\nrelationship\n\nNote: As a worker co-operative, there are specific conditions regarding members and employees, \naddressed in Article [1], [144.1] and [145] of the Ontario Co-operative Corporations Act. \nA summary is provided below:\n\nArticle 1 (1)\n\"Worker co-operative\" means a co-operative whose primary object is to provide employment to its members and as a condition of membership that, except in certain circumstances, a member must be employed by the co-operative (roughly at least 75 % of all employees are members of the co-operative, there are specific exemptions).\nArticle 1 (1.2) (and repeated in 144.1 (2))\nAn employee is not a permanent full-time employee if they are employed for a probationary period of one year or less; are employed under a contract for a term of two years or less; or have regular hours of work [that are] less than fifteen hours per week.\nArticle 145 (4)The co-operative must maintain a minimum of three members.\n\n\n"},"compensation-benefits.html":{"url":"compensation-benefits.html","title":"Compensation and Benefits","keywords":"","body":"Compensation and Benefits\nCash Compensation\nMembers at Hypha, full-time or part-time, permanent or otherwise, are evaluated based on the following criteria:\n\nskills and experiences\nresponsibilities\nseniority in organization\n\nFull details and salary tiers are specified in our Employee Salary Guide.\nVacation Days\nMembers are entitled to three weeks of flexible plus one week of fixed time off. For a full-time member working four-day weeks, that amounts to 12 days of flexible vacation days plus the fixed week of December Holidays.\nFull details about time off is specified in our Holidays, Time Off, and Leaves page.\nHealth Benefits\nCanadian employees are eligible for enrolment into our group benefits plan three months after their start date. Foreign contractors receive a modifier to their cash salary in place of group benefits.\nOur provider is the Co-operators and we are able to provide the following to members based on hours worked:\n\n\n\nEmployee Status\nBenefits\n\n\n\n\nPT (0.25 or 1 day/week )\nNo benefits\n\n\nPT (0.50 or 2 days/week)\nLife, AD&D, LTD + HSA\n\n\nFT (0.75 or 3 days/week, and above)\nLife, AD&D, LTD, EHC, Dental + HSA\n\n\n\nWhat do all of those mean? See their definitions by the Co-operators.\nLabour Patronage\nAs a worker co-operative, Hypha has a policy of allocating part of our annual surplus (or loss) towards individual members' capital accounts, as defined in section 6.4 of our bylaws.\nThe co-operative keeps an account balance for each full member. After each fiscal year, 20% of the co-operative's surplus/loss in that year is allocated among all the members according to labour contribution (i.e., time commitment) through the fiscal year.\nCurrently, the account balance is loaned to the co-operative at 0% interest as liquidity for business activities. There is no process for members to receive the balance, except when a member resigns their membership, at which point their account balance is paid out.\nClient Initiative Allocations\nHypha participates in projects where clients may offer incentives to key individual contributors in the form of shares (e.g., founders shares, stock options, Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)), tokens, bonuses, or other incentive-alignment mechanisms. Members are free to make these arrangements directly with clients as appropriate. These incentives are owned and managed by the individual, and do not involve the co-op.\nHistorically, there have been cases where Hypha receives a small allocation, or where the co-operative participates in the capitalization table. There are also instances where neither individuals nor the co-op are involved in the allocation agreements. The arrangement depends on the client's intention and Hypha's role in the project. In cases where the co-op receives asset allocations, they become part of Hypha's assets and are collectively managed by the membership, similar to other asset types.\nDemocratic Governance Participation\nA worker co-operative is democratically managed by its membership; this means that all key decisions require one-person-one-vote approvals as defined in our bylaws. These decisions are made throughout the year, and most importantly at our Annual General Meeting.\nIn their first year, probationary members participate in many of the important Hypha-related discussions without actual voting power. Once someone is accepted as a full member, they become a voting worker-member who is responsible for the strategic direction of the co-operative and its obligations to the membership.\n"},"salary.html":{"url":"salary.html","title":"Employee Salary Guide","keywords":"","body":"Employee Salary Guide\nThis document outlines the salary tiers of Hypha members and the review process.\nEvaluation\nThe base salary for each member is determined according to:\nBase Salary = 50,000 CAD * L^l * R^r * S^s * Modifiers + Adjustment\nwith the following criteria:\n\n\n\nCriteria\nScaling factor\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nL=1.160\nSkills and experiences l=[0-6]\n\n\nResponsibility\nR=1.120\nResponsibilities r=[0-4]\n\n\nSeniority\nS=1.025\nSeniority in organization s=[0-3]\n\n\nCommitment\n0.250-1.200\nModifier applied to members working part-time or over-time each week\n\n\nContractor\n1.050\nModifier applied to contractors who do not receive employee benefits\n\n\nGeo-upscaling\n1.150\nModifier applied to members living in higher cost of living regions compared to Canadian average\n\n\nGeo-downscaling\n0.850\nModifier applied to members living in lower cost of living regions compared to Canadian average\n\n\nAdjustment\n\nCustom dollar amount adjustment applied on a case-by-case basis\n\n\n\nAt salary review time, each member will perform a self-assessment to suggest their L and R to an review group made up of other members who are most suited to contribute to their evaluation.

We use GitHub Projects to track tasks that primarily come from two repositories:\n\nhyphacoop/organizing: Default tasks\nhyphacoop/organizing-private: Confidential tasks\n\nA task is assigned to a Working Group (WG) or Project Group (PG) using Labels,\nthen it becomes the responsibility of the group.\nA task may further be assigned to a specific member.\nLabels are also used to indicate priorities of tasks.\nNote that while most tasks show up as Issues from hyphacoop/organizing and hyphacoop/organizing-private, there will also be Issues from other repositories, and some items that require your attention will show up as Pull Requests. The above search filters will catch everything. It is recommended for members to bookmark the search filters that apply to them in their browser and check them everyday.\nMembers are encouraged to use emojis liberally to indicate they have, for example: üëÄ read the comment, üëç agree or üëé disagree with the comment, etc. This applies generally to all our tools.\nReal-time Chat\nWe use Matrix as real-time chat for day-to-day task discussions and pinging members for urgent requests.\nAll members are encouraged to install a Matrix client on their phone, and configure notifications for +hyphacoop:tomesh.net rooms to Mentions only. In messages, we refer to members by initials and only use handles when trying to trigger a notification to bring someone to a conversation (i.e., an urgent ping). There is otherwise no expectation that members will check the chat regularly, or catch up on backscrolls, therefore it is important to be intentional in bringing summaries of decisions made back into Issues in GitHub.\nShared Calendar\nWe have two shared Google Calendars:\n\nhyphacoop: Internal meetings and public events of interest\nhyphacoop: availability: Member office hours and member travels (as all-day events)\n\nMembers can use office hours to identify work hour overlaps with each other, where they can expect peers to be on chat and likely to be available for calls.

The aim is to transform it. \n‚ÄîDiane Musho Hamilton\n\nAll member-workers, employees and contractors of Hypha Worker Co-operative must agree to follow Hypha's Code of Conduct, principles of being a good member and uphold the co-op's values when working together. These form the guidelines for our work together.\nWhen conflict within the co-operative arises, which is both natural, expected, and normal, the following process should be followed to transform the conflict into a better, or at the minimum, neutral experience for those involved. The goal of this process is to transform the conflict at the lowest level of escalation. \nStep 1. Personal reflection and support\nBefore discussing the conflict with the person(s) involved, take some time to reflect and consider the situation. Focus on understanding and naming your own feelings and reactions. Connect with a neutral third party (they can be a Hypha employee/member/contractor or someone outside the co-op) to discuss the situation, if this is an option. Move to Step 2 if the situation feels unresolved after working through it individually. \nStep 2. Have a direct conversation with the person\nBefore engaging in discussion with the person(s) involved, consider what you want to say. Resources for framing this discussion can be found in the NVC (non-violent communication) process or the DESC (Describe, Express, Specify and Consequences) framework. Pick a time and place that works for both parties. Use the framings outlined in the suggested resources to guide the discussion. Try to be considerate of the other person's perspective and feelings. Bring your best, most professional self to the discussion. If this isn't possible with your current mindframe, consider postponing until you feel calmer.\nStep 3. Engage in a supported conversation\nIf you can't resolve the problem after meeting and talking it through, a neutral mediator or third-party should be brought in (note: they don't need to be a trained mediator). This person should be trusted by all involved in the conflict, and they must commit to listening to everyone equally. The mediator in the conversation will not seek to solve the conflict but will instead keep people focused and on track during the discussion, while encouraging them to come to a resolution to the challenge. The mediator commits to active and equal listening and to asking clarifying questions throughout the discussion. These 4 non-violent communications tips for mediators can be used as a guide. \nStep 4. Consult a panel of colleagues\nIf the conflict cannot be managed by direct discussion or mediation, then the next step is to convene a panel of colleagues. As Hypha does not have a group dedicated to this, the Board of Directors is tasked with either appointing a neutral and external third-party organization, or participating directly by listening to both sides and ideally, staying in the conversation until a resolution is reached. If the conflict includes members of the Board, those parties will not be included on the panel.\nStep 5. Move from conflict transformation process to employment matter\nIf the above steps are not successful in resolving the conflict, the situation will become an employment matter. At this stage, members not engaged in the conflict will be asked to gather information about the situation and recommend next steps. Irresolvable conflicts may lead to someone leaving the co-operative, referral to external authorities if relevant, and/or systemic/structural changes to the co-op.\nThis process was shaped by drawing on resources from Loomio, Corporate Rebels, and New Ways of Working.  \n"},"finance.html":{"url":"finance.html","title":"Finance","keywords":"","body":"Finance\nThis document outlines finance and accounting practices of Hypha Worker Co-operative, including:\n\nList of accounts at our financial institutions\nClient invoicing and accepted payment methods\nMember payroll and expense reimbursements\nTools and procedures for bookkeeping, accounting, and tax remittances\n\nThere are two organizational roles associated with carrying out the day-to-day financial processes at Hypha‚Äîthe Finance Steward and Payroll Coordinator.\nContents\n\nFinance\nContents\nFinancial Accounts\nInvoicing Clients\n\n\nGenerating Timesheets\nGenerating Invoices\nSettling Payments\nMember Payroll\n\n\nCalculating Member Wages\nExpense Reimbursement\nPublic Holiday Pay\nReporting & Remitting Taxes\n\n\nCorporate Income Tax (RC)\nPayroll Deduction (RP)\nGST/HST (RT)\nHolding crypto-currency\n\n\n\nFinancial Accounts\n\nFinancial institution: Desjardins\nAccount type: business chequing\nPayment requirements from account:\n: sign-off by one signing member in the Finance WG\n> CAD$200: sign-off by two signing members in the Finance WG\n\n\n\nHypha is expected to conduct business with clients from other countries and is ready to accept funds in CAD, USD, EUR, and GBP.\nWe use TransferWise to minimize transaction and currency exchange fees.\nOur TransferWise account has local accounts in Canada, United States, Europe, and the United Kingdom, so we can bill clients as a local financial institution in their local currency.\nOur TransferWise account does not require multiple signatures, and the Finance WG is responsible for transferring money into our main Desjardins account when accumulated funds exceed a CAD 10,000 threshold, or earlier as deemed appropriate.\nInvoicing Clients\nHypha charges clients on a sliding scale, and projects may be billed hourly, weekly, monthly, or per project, depending on the specifics of each project.\nThe recommended practice is to send an invoice every month, or a quote if the amount for the month is small and at the discretion of the project.\nMember Payroll\nMember wages are paid on the pay day, which is the 15th of each month or the last working day prior if the 15th happens to land on a holiday.\nA Member's wage is calculated based on the billable hours of work rendered up to the end of the previous month.\nFor example:\n\nThe March 15 pay day covers the \"pay period\" of February, and it pays for the work rendered throughout the month of February.\n\nBefore the 7th of each month, Members must submit payroll information to the Employee Payroll sheet in order to be paid for the pay period covering the previous month.\nAll wages, expense reimbursements, and withheld taxes are managed by the Payroll Coordinator using Wagepoint and Quickbooks Online, which are linked to our main Desjardins account.\nCalculating Member Wages\nEach Member's wage for a pay period is calculated based on the projects and roles they participate in, and it usually varies from month to month.\nPay from billable project work will have a percent-based portion (the \"clip\") deducted from it to fund administrative costs and collective programs of the Co-operative.\nCollective programs, current and prospective, include:\n\nVacation pay\nPublic holiday pay\nCPP & EI employer contributions\nMember health benefits (future)\nSolidarity projects fund (future)\nMember & co-op development fund (future)\nReserve fund (future)\nOther collective expenses of the Co-operative\n\nThe regular pay of a Member is calculated with:\nREGULAR_PAY = (1 - CLIP) * BILLED_AMOUNT (before transaction costs)\nThe clip is currently set at 35% and is the same across all projects over a period, but can be revised as necessary by consensus.\nIn addition to the regular pay, Members are entitled to:\n\n5% public holiday pay based on the regular pay amount\n4% vacation pay based on the regular + public holiday pay amount\nCPP & EI employer contributions\n\nThese annualized amounts are calculated and included for each pay period.\nYou can use the Wage Calculator to determine these amounts.\nAfter tax withholdings and other applicable deductions (e.g. CPP & EI employee contributions), the net amount is electronically transferred to the Member's bank account on pay day using Wagepoint.\nRefer to the guides for Payroll to set up the payroll run for each pay period.\nExpense Reimbursement\nMember expenses eligible for reimbursement should be submitted to the Expense Reimbursement sheet and receipts uploaded to Employee Expense Receipts in the same quarter they are incurred.\nReimbursements are paid out with wages on the next pay day, but do not appear on tax forms.\nFollow the guides for Expense Reimbursement to submit an eligible expense.\nPublic Holiday Pay\nHypha is closed on public holidays and Members recieve 5% annualized public holiday pay in their wages every pay period. \nIn the case where Member-workers work on holidays, they receive regular wages with \"substitute time off\" and there is no expectation of \"public holiday plus premium pay\", following the Employment Standards Act of Ontario. Wages for work performed on public holidays are calculated without \"premium pay\" because Members have significantly variable hours of work per period and a 5% annualized public holiday pay is included in Member wages in every pay period. Members are already adequately compensated for any \"substitute time off\" and set their own schedule. This strikes a balance between those who want the time off and those who want the flexibility to work on the day. \nReporting & Remitting Taxes\nHypha has the following program accounts with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA):\n\n‚òëÔ∏è RC0001 Corporate Income Tax (RC) is filed/reported and remitted/paid each tax year\n‚òëÔ∏è RP0001 Payroll Deduction (RP) is reported and paid each pay period\n‚òëÔ∏è RT0001 GST/HST (RT) is reported and paid each quarter\n\nCorporate Income Tax (RC)\nHypha is incorporated as a non-share capital worker co-operative under the Ontario Co-operative Corporations Act, and is organizationally a non-profit.\nFor income tax purposes, Hypha is a non-profit organization under the Canadian Income Tax Act.\nNet assets are put into funds restricted for a particular purpose in accordance with our organizational mission, and our balance sheets show zero retained earnings/profit.\nAt each fiscal year-end, set on June 30, the Finance WG works with our accountant and bookkeeper to file our annual corporation income tax return, even though we pay no corporate income tax as a non-profit organization.\nPayroll Deduction (RP)\nWage deductions and remittances are handled through Wagepoint on their non-accelerated remittance schedule.\nIf any pay period is skipped, a nil remittance is manually filed to CRA directly.\nAt the end of each year, Hypha issues a T4 to each employee and a T4A to each contractor to support personal income tax filings, and reports to CRA accordingly. This is also handled using Wagepoint.\nGST/HST (RT)\nThe GST/HST Information for Non-Profit Organizations applies to Hypha for GST/HST purposes.\nWe started collecting GST/HST as of May 15, 2020 with a quarterly reporting period and our fiscal year end date for GST/HST return on June 30.\nMuch of our digital services (e.g. software development, system administration, design) for international clients (outside of Canada) are GST/HST zero-rated as they are classified as exported goods and services.\nThis is different from GST/HST exempt because zero-rated items are still eligible for Input Tax Credit (ITC) on related expenditures.\nThis is described under Intangible personal property and Excise Tax Act section 10 of Part V of Schedule VI.\nWhether we will charge and claim GST/HST is dependent on a few factors.\nHere are some likely scenarios that may apply to Hypha projects:\n\nHypha provides IT consultation and software development service to a Canadian client and subcontracts a Canadian web developer, spends $100 on web hosting and $1,000 on a laptop to help us fulfill the contract.\n\nWe will charge 13% HST when invoicing the Canadian client\nThe Canadian subcontractor:\nif incorporated (e.g. a company), may charge us 13% HST when invoicing us, which we can reclaim as ITC\nif unincorporated (e.g. a person), has no GST/HST implications as we will add them to payroll and issue a T4A at the end of the year\n\n\nWe are eligible to reclaim the 13% HST of $100 paid to acquire web hosting as ITC\nWe are eligible to reclaim the 13% HST of $1,000 paid to acquire the laptop as ITC\n\ni. Same scenario, but the client is a non-Canadian company.\n\nWe will charge no HST when invoicing the client, and mark as zero-rated on the invoice since the service is considered intellectual property exports\nThe Canadian subcontractor may charge us 13% HST when invoicing us, which we can still reclaim as ITC\nWe are still eligible for all ITC claims as above\n\nii. Same scenario, but the subcontractor is a non-resident of Canada and the service is rendered outside the country.\n\nThe international subcontractor, incorporated or unincorporated, will charge us no GST/HST when invoicing us (Hypha can pay the invoice via TransferWise in a supported currency of their preference), there is no ITC claim on the payment\nWe are still eligible for all other ITC claims as above\n\niii. Same scenario, but the subcontractor is a non-resident of Canada and the service is rendered inside the country.\n\nHypha needs to open a non-resident tax withholding account with CRA and remit 25% of the gross payment as withholding tax, and handle applicable end of year filings\n\n\nHypha receives a grant from a private company to facilitate a free digital security workshop that is open to public, and spends $100 on materials.\n\nHST does not apply, and we do not need to collect or remit GST/HST on the grant amount\nThe $100 materials is not eligible as ITC because the grant is GST/HST exempt (different from zero-rated)\n\ni. Same scenario, but the workshop has a registration fee collected by the client, and is not open to public.\n\nWe need to charge 13% HST when invoicing the client, this is no longer a \"grant\"\nWe are eligible to reclaim the 13% HST of $100 materials as ITC\n\n\n\nIf none of these scenarios apply to your situation, and you are unsure whether to charge GST/HST on an invoice, or whether an expense is eligible as ITC, please reach out to the Finance WG.\nHolding crypto-currency\nHypha may sometimes need to hold cryptocurrencies. \n\nWe have a key holder role to manage our keys.\nWe have a Cosmos multisig treasury wallet üîí, a hot wallet, and various purpose-specific wallets listed in our account information üîí\n\n"},"fiscal-sponsorship.html":{"url":"fiscal-sponsorship.html","title":"Fiscal Sponsorship","keywords":"","body":"Fiscal Sponsorship\nHypha is a Canadian Fiscal Host on the Open Collective platform.

These are the terms of the relationship entered into between:\n\nHypha Worker Co-operative Inc. (Ontario Corporation No. 5019866) (\"Us\" or \"Hypha\"); and\nthe Collective, which has agreed to these terms and conditions (\"You\" or \"the Collective\").\nThis agreement (\"Agreement\") is entered into with effect from the date (\"Effective Date\") that you confirm, by ticking the relevant box, that you have read and agree to these terms and that Hypha has accepted your request to include your Collective as part of Hypha and provide support to You for the purposes you described in your application.\n\n\n\nRecitals. The parties enter into this Agreement with reference to the following facts:\n\nHypha is a non-share capital worker co-operative based in Toronto. We are a non-profit organization.\n\nHypha's mission is to cultivate collective growth and meaningful livelihoods through learning and building technologies together. We work in solidarity with our neighbours, where we support each other and provide safe harbour to imagine and create alternative futures (\"Hypha's Mission\").\n\nThe Collective, with its stated mission, meets the criteria for engaging Hypha as a fiscal sponsor as according to Exhibit A (\"Protocols\"). The Collective agrees to continue to align with Hypha's Mission in the future.\n\nThe Collective and Hypha mutually desire to enter a fiscal sponsorship relationship as according to the terms set out in this Agreement.\n\nThe parties agree that Hypha shall:\n\nreceive funds for the Collective (\"Funds\") to be held by Hypha; and\nafter discussing with You, control these funds for the use of the Collective (less any administrative charges, interest, and expenses).\n\n\n\n\nTerm. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date, and will continue unless and until terminated under clause 10 of this Agreement.\n\nRelationship. Nothing in this Agreement means that the Collective or its members and/or agents is an agent or legal representative of Hypha for any purpose whatsoever except as provided in this Agreement.\n\nProtocols. Hypha has established certain protocols set out in Exhibit A. This sets out how Hypha shall manage and operate and deal with any funds.\n Hypha will provide the Protocols to the Collective and may from time to time update the Protocols to assist Hypha in performing its obligations effectively.\n\nFunds. You may solicit unconditional gifts, contributions, sponsorships, and grants to Hypha for the purpose of the Collective, where the payer is not receiving any specific good or service in return.\n The Collective understands, acknowledges and agrees that Hypha is not a registered charity or donee organisation, and that such funds collected by Hypha for the Collective will not have donation tax receipts issued for them and will not entitle the giver to a donation tax credit or a tax deduction.\n If the Collective wishes to accept conditional payments, where the payer receives a specific good or service in return, you must provide notice in writing to Hypha so that we can ensure any applicable Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) or other taxes are applied.\n\nThird party agreements. If You want to enter into any agreement or obligation with a donor, sponsor, vendor or other third party, to provide or receive services beyond simply receiving a donor's financial contributions, you must first provide notice of the specific details to Us and obtain Hypha's prior written consent, as these agreements or obligations will legally be between Hypha and the third party.\n\nIntellectual property. Any and all tangible or intangible property, including intellectual property, such as copyrights of the Collective, belong to You. Furthermore, You represent that you have the power and right to advance the Collective. We acknowledge and agree that any trademarks, trade names, artwork, designs, logos, copy, and all other intellectual property  provided to Hypha by the Collective or its agents (for example, to be put on websites) belongs to the Collective and not to Us. For the avoidance of doubt, you should register ownership in the name of an individual associated with the Collective rather than in the name of Hypha.\n\nThe Collective. Hypha will receive funds earmarked for support of the Collective, and make disbursements for expenses incurred in furtherance of the Collective. Beginning on the Effective Date, Hypha will place all such revenues received by Hypha and identified with the Collective into an account to be used for the benefit of the Collective's mission as that mission periodically may be defined by the Collective with the approval of Hypha. Hypha will exercise full control over the Collective's financial administration, management, and disbursement of the Fund.\n For the avoidance of doubt, the parties note that all money will be reported as the income of Hypha, for both tax purposes and for purposes of Hypha's financial statements. Accordingly, Hypha is responsible for the processing and deposit in the Fund of all monies received for the Collective.\n We will consult together around any payments to be made out to cover expenses of the Collective as detailed in the Protocols.\n\nTermination. Either Hypha or the Collective may terminate this Agreement on 30 days' written notice to the other party.\nUpon a termination notice being given, the Collective will notify Hypha of how the funds will be dealt with, from the following three options:\n\nsubmit a request that the balance is paid out as a legitimate Collective expense (submitted and processed as per the Protocols);\ndonate the funds of the Collective to another Collective hosted by Hypha; or\nHypha will donate the funds to a Canadian registered charity.\n\nIf no notice is provided that elects one of these options by the Collective within the 30 days' written notice period, then the default is for the funds to be donated to a registered charity by Hypha (option 3).\nIn addition, if no member of the Collective has responded to a request for termination instructions by Hypha for a period of 12 months then the funds will automatically be donated to a registered charity by Hypha.\n\nNotice. Each notice under this Agreement shall be in writing and delivered personally or sent by post or email to the person at the address or email notified in writing from time to time.\nA notice is deemed to be received:\n\nif delivered personally, when delivered;\nif posted, five business days after posting; or\nif sent by email, when actually received.\n\n\nDisputes. Before taking any Court action, a party must use best efforts to resolve any dispute under, or in connection with, the Agreement through good faith negotiations.\nIf there is a dispute between the parties in relation to this Agreement, either party may give the other party notice of the dispute.\nWithin 10 business days of receipt of the notice of dispute, the parties shall meet (in person or online) to endeavour to resolve the dispute.\nIf the dispute is not resolved within 20 business days of receipt of the notice of the dispute, either party may by notice to the other party refer the dispute to mediation, which will take place in person or online, with each party paying half of the cost of the mediation.\nWhile any dispute remains unresolved, each party shall continue to perform this Agreement to the extent practicable, but without prejudice to their respective rights and remedies.\n\nLiabilities & indemnification. You are responsible for all activities of the Collective, including any financial or other liabilities, and you indemnify and hold harmless Hypha and its representatives from any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) resulting from your performance of your obligations contained in this Agreement.\nYou also indemnify Us from any loss or liability resulting from injury (including sickness, disease or loss of life) to any person, or damage to any property of any third party at or as a result of your activities or the Collective.\nYou also indemnity Us in relation to any claims from third parties that you have violated any intellectual property laws.\n\nForce majeure. Neither party is liable to the other for any failure to perform its obligations under the Agreement to the extent caused by force majeure (which are events beyond the reasonable control of the affected party, such as a pandemic or natural disaster), provided that the affected party:\n\nimmediately notifies the other party and provides full information about the force majeure;\nuses best efforts to overcome the force majeure; and\ncontinues to perform its obligations to the extent practicable.\n\nEach party must take reasonable steps to mitigate any loss or damage, cost or expense it may suffer or incur arising out of anything done or not done by the other party under or in connection with the Agreement.\n\nJurisdiction. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Ontario and Canada as they apply in Ontario.\n\nEntire agreement & modification. This Agreement supersedes any prior oral or written understandings or communications between the parties and constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be amended by Us from time to time by posting new versions of these terms on our website and notifying You. By continuing to use the services of Hypha you will confirm that you agree to the modified terms.\n\nMiscellaneous. If there is any inconsistency between these terms and any other document submitted by You or any other arrangement with Us, these terms prevail unless otherwise agreed by Us in writing.\nTo waive a right under this Agreement, that waiver must be in writing and signed by the waiving party.\nThe parties are independent, and this Agreement does not create any partnership, agency or employment relationship between them.\nIf any provision of these terms and conditions is held by any court to be illegal, void or unenforceable, such determination shall not impair the enforceability of the remaining provisions.\n\n\nExhibit A: Protocols\nThe following are the policies and processes of Hypha's fiscal sponsorship.\nCriteria: The Collective will provide evidence and Hypha will confirm that the Collective has met the criteria for engaging Hypha as a fiscal sponsor, being that the Collective has a mission that is value-aligned with Hypha's mission and carry out activities that create positive social impact.\nHypha fees and expenses: The Collective will be required to pay membership fees (\"Fees\") and cover any expenses Hypha incurred on the Collective's behalf as a result of this Agreement. The Collective is responsible to pay from the Fund the Fees that consist of:\n\n5% of all of the funds deposited into the Fund, regardless of source, for purposes of becoming a Collective of Hypha and maintaining such membership; or\nany specific amounts agreed between us in writing (due, for example, to there being a specific sum which we agree to look after for a specific fee); and\nall interest earned on the Fund which will be retained in Hypha's general fund.\n\nPayment processor expenses: In addition to the Fees, the Collective is responsible for any merchant account credit card processing expenses incurred by Hypha as a result of administration of the Fund, which are directly related to the Collective's purpose. Such expenses shall be pulled directly from the Fund by Hypha.\nPlatform: Upon execution of this Agreement, the Collective will be featured on Open Collective, an accounting and crowdfunding platform (the \"Platform\"), specifically on Hypha's page, which is owned by Hypha.\nHypha will set the Collective up on the Platform such that the Collective will have its own dedicated page that tracks, in total transparency, the funds that it raises and the expenses it incurs in relation to the Collective.\nThe Collective's page on the Platform will be linked to Hypha's Stripe account, PayPal account, TransferWise account, and bank account, so that Hypha has control over the funds received and disbursed under the Platform for purposes of the Collective. The Platform thus serves as a fundraising avenue for the Collective, enabling it to raise funds and be reimbursed for expenses incurred in relation to the Collective.\nThe Platform makes the revenue and expenses of the Collective available to the public through a transparent ledger.\nDisbursements: In order to receive a disbursement from the funds raised to cover expenses incurred in furtherance of the Collective, those seeking payment must submit receipts/invoices onto the Platform for review by the Hypha staff, via the \"Submit Expense\" feature on the Collective's page.\nUpon Hypha's receipt of receipts/invoices, it will review all documentation to ensure the expenses incurred are valid. Upon approval by the Hypha staff, Hypha will reimburse those expenses to the payee through the Platform using PayPal, TransferWise, bank transfer, or another mutually agreed payment option. Each time Hypha reimburses the Collective for such expenses, the funds allocated to the Collective on the Platform will automatically decrease by the amount reimbursed.\nFunds received & expenses paid outside platform: In the event that the Collective receives funding outside of the Platform (that which does not go automatically and directly into the Fund), Hypha will use a feature enabled on the Platform to 'Manually Add Funds' to the Collective's balance. This means that Hypha will assign the funds received in the Fund destined to the Collective, thus increasing its budget. In the same fashion, if an expense is paid outside of the Platform by the Collective, because, for example, the recipient does not hold a PayPal account or another payout method is required, then Hypha will use the 'Mark as Paid' feature on the Platform, which allows Hypha to record that an expense has already been paid through a different method and that amount is automatically deducted from the Collective's Fund balance.\nThis page was last updated on November 11, 2020.

As a consultancy, Hypha requires members to have a mix of billable and non-billable time commitments. Initiative leads (i.e. project leads) are responsible for determining the appropriate time commitment of their team members; this is revised per quarter across the organization. Each member is also alloted at least one half-day per week to spend on internal work related to the co-operative.\nInitiative leads invoice clients based on the team capacity committed to their initiative. Team members are responsible for managing their own time accordingly, and for ensuring they are meeting the delivery expectations set out by their leads.\nHow this works in practice\nIf Alice works 4 days a week at Hypha and works on two client initiatives, her commitment will look something like this:\n\n\n\nInitiative\nCommitment\n\n\n\n\nClient initiative A\n2.0 day\n\n\nClient initiative B\n1.5 day\n\n\nHypha (non-billable)\n0.5 day\n\n\n\nBased on this, Alice's time is 87.5% billable. When we invoice the clients, Hypha bills Alice's day rate, for example at $1,600 x 2 for Client A and $1,600 x 1.5 for Client B = $5,600 per week.\nFinancial forecasting\nFor the Finance Working Group's projections, we know that Hypha:\n\nhas 12 days of public holiday equivalent to three 4-day weeks\nhas Christmas week closure (Dec 27-Jan 1) roughly equal to one 4-day week\nhas three weeks of vacation for the employee\n\nTherefore, Alice works 45 of the 52 calendar weeks in a year. 45 x $5,600 = $252,000 is effectively the revenue that Alice brings in over the calendar year.\n"},"pet.html":{"url":"pet.html","title":"Pet Policy","keywords":"","body":"Pet Policy\nHypha is a pet-friendly workplace.

Online.\nDomestic\n\nAfter the money arrives to Desjardins, we need to update our records in Quickbooks Online:\n\nIn the Banking tab, select our Chequing account and click Update to sync our Desjardins account.\n\nFind the transaction from the client and click on it, then select Find match to select the incoming transaction to match.\n\nIf there is a discrepancy in the amounts, click the Resolve button and change CATEGORY to Bank charges, and GST/HST to Exempt (0%) since bank charges are exempt items, then click Save.\n\n\n\nArchive the PDF of the paid and finalized invoice in our shared drive under the Invoices directory with filename xxxx-project.pdf, where xxxx is the invoice number (e.g. 1001-aether.pdf).\n\n\nForeign Currency\n\nConfirm the correct amount is received, then convert the foreign currency to CAD.\nWe can either move the money to the CAD balance in TransferWise, or if the amount is large, we can directly deposit the exchanged amount into our Desjardins account.\nThe following example shows how to do that in a single transaction from TransferWise:\n\nConfirm that the invoice amount of 3,757.50 USD is received to our USD balance, then click Send USD.\n\n\n\nChoose My business and enter in our Desjardins account information for the deposit.\n\n\n\nNote the invoice number in the Reference field, then click Confirm and send.\n\nIn this example, a client in the United States sent 3,757.50 USD to the Hypha USD account at TransferWise, and we deposited 4,904.11 CAD at the Hypha CAD account at Desjardins.\nThe transaction and exchange fee was 20.61 USD, and the exchange rate was 1.31235.\nIf invoice amounts are small, we may batch many of them in TransferWise before depositing to Desjardins, but we should still convert foreign currencies to CAD as soon as possible and hold the amount as CAD in our TransferWise CAD balance.\n\nIn the USD balance, click on Download a statement and download a CSV file for the date range that includes the transaction(s).\nOpen the file and multiply the amounts with the exchange rate column, then save.\n\n\n\nAfter the money arrives to Desjardins, we need to update our records in Quickbooks Online:\n\nClick on the invoice and add a line item that accommodates for the discrepancy in estimated and actual exchange rates.\n In our example where we deposited 4,904.11 CAD to Desjardins, if our invoice estimated a CAD AMOUNT of 4,950.00 CAD, we would record an Exchange rate adjustment @ 1.31235 line item with -45.89 as AMOUNT.\n Make sure you take the exchange rate from the TransferWise CSV.\n\nIn the Banking tab, select our Chequing account and click Update to sync our Desjardins account.\n Find the transaction from TransferWise and click on it, and change the Category to TransferWise, change Tax code to Out of Scope (Sales) since this is an internal transfer, then click Add.\n\nIn the Banking tab, select our TransferWise account to click File upload (down arrow next to Update) to update our TransferWise account.\n Browse and upload the TransferWise CSV we saved earlier, select TransferWise as the account, then click Next and enter the following:\n\nDate: Column 2\nDescription: Column 5\nAmount: Column 3\n\nClick Next twice, and then Yes to import.\n\nFind the transaction from the client and click on it, then select Find match to select the incoming transaction to match.\n There should be no discrepancy in the amounts.\n\nFind the transaction from our TransferWise account to Desjardins account, then select Find match.\n We expect a discrepancy in the amounts.\n Click the Resolve button and change CATEGORY to Bank charges, then click Save.\n\nIf there is a discrepancy, click the Resolve button and change CATEGORY to Bank charges, and GST/HST to Exempt (0%) since bank charges are exempt items, then click Save.\n\n\n\nArchive the PDF of the paid and finalized invoice in our shared drive under the Invoices directory with filename
