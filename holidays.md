# Holidays, Time Off, and Leaves

### Public and Additional Holidays

Our virtual office is closed during [Ontario's nine public holidays](https://www.ontario.ca/document/your-guide-employment-standards-act-0/public-holidays) 
and member-workers are entitled (encouraged) to those days off and receive an [annualized public holiday pay](/finance.htmlfinance.md#public-holiday-pay). 
We recognize three additional holidays where the office is closed and members are encouraged not to work: 
Civic Holiday (first Monday in August), May Day or International Workers' Day (May 1), and Remembrance Day (November 11). 
During December Holidays the virtual office is closed for roughly two weeks. 

In cases where members choose to work on these days, or under special circumstances where a project requires, 
they will receive [regular wages](/finance.md#public-holiday-pay) for those hours and are entitled to take substitute time off.

### Sick Days, Personal Time Off, and Leaves of Absense
  
We have no policy limiting the number of sick days, time-off, or leaves that members take.
However, we recognize taking any of the above has to be balanced against existing deadlines and commitments.

Member-workers should notify Operations as soon as possible by email: [operations@hypha.coop](mailto:operations@hypha.coop), 
with any planned or unplanned time off.
