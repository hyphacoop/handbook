# Hypha Worker Co-operative Code of Conduct

Hypha Worker Co-operative strives to cultivate collective and inclusive growth in our communities, and to support meaningful livelihoods for our members, employees, contractors and collaborators. We offer a respectful and open workplace. Hypha is committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or technical skill level. 

Our Code of Conduct states our shared ideals. We strive to be considerate, respectful, and collaborative in our conversations and interactions with one another.

When conflict arises, we follow the [Conflict Transformation Process](https://handbook.hypha.coop/conflict-transformation.html) to collaboratively reach a resolution. 

## Our Standards

We do not tolerate harassment of organization members, employees, contractors, or collaborators in any form. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, technical skill level;
* Sexual images in public and online spaces;
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, following;
* Harassing photography or recording;
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events;
* Inappropriate physical contact;
* Unwelcome sexual attention;
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any project interactions, including in online spaces.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to project and work spaces both online and in-person, and to public spaces (e.g. events, conferences etc.) when an individual is representing Hypha Worker Co-operative.

## Invoking Hypha’s Code of Conduct

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or asked to leave, at the discretion of the Hypha members and employees. If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, we may take any action we deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from events and online forums.

Code of Conduct violations exist on a spectrum. The Code of Conduct exists to protect our participants and values, not simply to punish offenders. Worker-members, employees and other  participants and collaborators are encouraged to invoke the Code of Conduct at a level appropriate to the offense, e.g. a 1:1 conversation expressing concern may be appropriate in some scenarios, immediate banning may be appropriate in others, and other scales of intervention might suit in-between situations. 

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a worker-member or employee immediately. Those who wish to report a violation but don’t feel comfortable talking to the organizers online or at an event can email coc@hypha.coop, which sends an email to Udit Vira and Andi Argast.

| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1        | Something egregiously bad happened and I am seeking immediate restitution                                                |
| 2        | Someone was harmed and we need to address it but it’s not immediate                                                      |
| 3         | The CoC was violated, I’m not sure if anyone was harmed, but we should do something to make sure it doesn’t happen again                                                                                                                         |
| 4        | I’m not sure if this is a CoC violation per se but I’d like to talk this through with someone and see if we should do more |
