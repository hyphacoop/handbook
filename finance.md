# Financial Accounts and Practices

_Note: Note all of the following have been implemented yet, the Finance WG is working on it_

This document outlines finance and accounting practices of Hypha Worker Co-operative, including:

- Listing of accounts at our financial institutions
- Process for invoicing clients and accepted methods of bill payments
- Process for payroll and expense reimbursement to Members
- Tools and procedures for bookkeeping, accounting, and tax remittances

## Organizational structure

Hypha Worker Co-operative is a worker co-operative incorporated in Ontario, Canada. The business has seven Founding Members, four of which are First Directors with signing authority. As a non-share-capital worker co-operative, we are a non-profit organization, and every Member holds both a Worker and an Owner relationship with the business.

## Financial accounts

Our main financial institution is **Desjardins** and our main funds are stored in a business chequing account, where all outgoing transactions require 2 signatures from Members of the Finance WG.

Hypha is expected to conduct business with clients from other countries and is ready to [accept funds in CAD, USD, and EUR](https://transferwise.com/help-smart/11/getting-started/2571907/what-currencies-do-you-support). We use **TransferWise** to minimize transaction and currency exchange fees. Our Transferwise account has local accounts in Canada, United States, and Europe, so we can bill clients as a local financial institution in their local currency. Our TransferWise account does not require multiple signatures, and the Finance WG is responsible for transfering money into our main Desjardins account when accumulated funds exceed a CAD 10,000 threshold.

## Invoicing a client

Hypha charges clients on a sliding scale, and projects may be billed hourly, weekly, monthly, or per project, depending on the specifics of each project. For all projects, regardless of how a customer is charged, Members log their hours using **Clockify**. For clients and billing models that require timesheets, Clockify is used to generate these timesheets to calculate the amount to invoice each period.

### Generating timesheets

1. Generate a per-member timesheet in Clockify and save (e.g. [aether_201908_bl](https://clockify.me/bookmarks/5dab94738a17084c0337690d) and [aether_201908_yj](https://clockify.me/bookmarks/5dab94828a17084c03376911))
1. Generate a team timesheet in Clockify and save (e.g. [aether_201908](https://clockify.me/bookmarks/5dab94a0ae125662897c69b4))
1. Export team timesheet as PDF to be sent to client, if applicable

This process is done using the Clockify [Summary Report](https://clockify.me/reports/summary). Saved reports are found under [Saved Reports](https://clockify.me/reports/saved).

### Generating invoices

1. Generate an invoice in **Quickbooks Online** based on the pricing structure (e.g. timesheet hours and project rate)
1. Add operational cost line item, if applicable
1. Add GST, if applicable

The general guidance is that the client is responsible for paying applicable GST and transaction costs charged by their financial institution, and Hypha absorbs the cost of receiving the money (e.g. cost of receiving a wire).

Invoices (and timesheets, if requested) are sent to clients and are payable in CAD, USD, or EUR. Invoices are due 14 days after the invoice date, after which a 5% late fee will be charged for each additional week.

## Member payroll

Member salaries are paid monthly and vary month-to-month depending on their billable hours of work. At the end of each month, each Member's entitled pay is calculated based on the projects and roles they participate in. After withholding taxes and other applicable deductions (e.g. CPP and EI), the net amount is electronically tranferred to the Member's bank account.

Expense reimbursements, which require photos uploaded to Quickbooks Online, are paid out monthly with the salary amount as non-taxable items in the paycheque.

At the end of each tax year, each Member is entitled to a vacation amount that equals 4% of their salary for the year. This amount will be added to the salary for that month.

All payroll, expense reimbursements, and withheld taxes are managed using Quickbooks Online, which is linked to our main Desjardins account.

### Calculating member salary

Each Member's pay from billable project work will have a percent-based portion taken from it to fund administrative costs and collective programs. Collective programs may include non-billable projects, member health benefits, CPP & EI, "rainy days" reserve contributions, as well as and other collective expenses of the co-operative. The amount is calculated based on the invoiced amount before transaction costs. The exact percentage is the same across all projects during a period and can be revised as necessary by consensus.

### Reporting and remitting taxes

Hypha has the following accounts with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA):

- **RC** for corporate income tax, which is reported and remitted each year
- **RP** for payroll deduction, which is reported and remitted each month

As a non-profit organization, our co-operative should have tax-exempt status and pay no corporate income tax. We do not have to collect GST/HST from clients and get GST/HST refunds for our puchases.

The Finance WG is responsible for bookkeeping and calculating salary deductions using Quickbooks Online, then reporting and remitting appropriate withheld salaries to CRA each month.

At the end of each calendar year, Hypha's accountant will send a T4 to each Member and to CRA for personal income tax filings. The accountant will also file annual tax returns and coordinate with the Finance WG to facilitate filings and remittances.
