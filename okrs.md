# Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

‚ö†Ô∏è _Warning: OKRs are in the process of being phased out at Hypha, the content below will soon be out of date._ ‚ö†Ô∏è

Hypha uses Objectives and Key Results for planning and setting collective goals.
We currently define OKRs at the working group level and update them quarterly in our [**OKR tracking sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hMFS3IhzZOFQA-yjt7lFcoVO0Ry6erFEH7D1NswvDtA/edit). 

## About OKRs

_Adapted from [Trello blog](https://blog.trello.com/okrs-set-achieve-track-trello)._

**OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results.** The Objectives tend to be the desired outcomes that you want, and the Key Results are the measurable ways you know you‚Äôre on track to reach them.

An **Objective** helps answer the question, _‚ÄúWhere do I want to go?‚Äù_  
A **Key Result** helps answer, _‚ÄúHow will I know I‚Äôm getting there?‚Äù_

## Reviewing and Identifying OKRs üöß

The OKR process is stewarded over **three weeks** by the [Cultivator](roles.md#cultivator-aka-meeting-chair) for the month. We follow a four-stage process for identifying and agreeing on goals:

#### 1. Recap and review (Week 1 All hands)

- Host at end of all-hands (~30 minutes)
- Look at OKRs from previous period
- Review current annual Strategic Plan (temporarily, the business plan) and Financial Forecast
- Check-in on other relevant information (e.g., our mission, values, time-sensitive information) and reflect on process

Session outcomes:
- Notes and reflections from all-hands meeting

#### 2. Brainstorm of organization and Working Group goals (Week 1 All hands)

- Host at end of all-hands (~10 minutes)
- Conduct individual brainstorming of goals, encourage people to add in more after call
- Group goals into existing working groups

Session outcomes:
- Notes with draft goals from all-hands meeting separated into WGs

#### 3. Working Groups refine goals into OKRs (Week 2 WG meetings)

- WGs take these goals and previous OKRs and discuss during their own meetings
- WGs convert goals into "objectives" and identify "key results" and update OKR spreadsheet

Session outcomes:
- Each WG has document with identified goals represented in/as OKRs 
- Updated OKR spreadsheet (each WG)

#### 4. Present and agree on OKRs (Week 3 All hands)

- During all hands, instead of WG updates each WG presents their OKRs and Cultivator presents org-wide OKRs
- Use OKR spreadsheet to discuss and make minor adjustments

Session outcomes:
- Shared understanding among members 
- Updated OKR spreadsheet (each WG and org-wide), with names assigned
- Updated page on handbook
