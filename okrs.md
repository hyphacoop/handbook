# Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

Hypha uses Objectives and Key Results for planning and setting collective goals.
We currently define OKRs at the working group level and update them quarterly in our [**OKR tracking sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hMFS3IhzZOFQA-yjt7lFcoVO0Ry6erFEH7D1NswvDtA/edit). 

## About OKRs

_Adapted from [Trello blog](https://blog.trello.com/okrs-set-achieve-track-trello)._

**OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results.** The Objectives tend to be the desired outcomes that you want, and the Key Results are the measurable ways you know you’re on track to reach them.

An **Objective** helps answer the question, _“Where do I want to go?”_  
A **Key Result** helps answer, _“How will I know I’m getting there?”_

## Objectives for 2020 Q1/2

## Process of Setting OKRs 🚧

The OKR process is stewarded over **three weeks** by the Cultivator for the month. We follow a four-stage process for identifying and agreeing on goals:

#### 1. Recap and review (Week 1 All hands)

- Separate meeting from all-hands (30 minutes after schedule)
- Look at OKRs from previous period
- Review current annual Strategic Plan (temporarily, the business plan) and Financial Forecast
- Check-in on other relevant information (e.g., our mission, values, time-sensitive information)

Outcomes:
- Notes from all-hands meeting

#### 2. Individual Brainstorming Org-Wide Goals (All hands)

- Host conversation at all hands
- Individual brainstorming of goals, can add in async after
- Cluster items into working groups

Outcomes:
- Notes with draft goals from all-hands meeting separated into WGs

#### 3. Working Group goals identified and refined into OKRs (Week 2 WG meetings)

- Working groups take OKRs and discuss at their own meeting
- WGs convert "goals" into "objectives" and identify "key results"

Outcomes:
- Each WG has document with OKRs 

#### 4. Present and Agree on OKRs (Week 3 All hands)

- Instead of working group updates, each working group presents their OKRs, steward presents org-wide OKRs
- Use spreadsheet to discuss and make minor adjustments

Outcomes:
- Shared understanding among members 
- Updated OKR spreadsheet (each WG and org-wide), with names assigned
- Updated page on handbook
