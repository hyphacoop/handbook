# Employee Salary Guide

This document outlines the salary tiers of Hypha members and the review process.

## Evaluation

The base salary for each member is determined according to:

```
Base Salary = 53,844  CAD * L^l * R^r * S^s * Modifiers + Adjustment
```

with the following criteria:

| Criteria           | Scaling factor  | Description                                                                             |
|:-------------------|----------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **L**evel          |       `L=1.160` | Skills and experiences `l=[0-6]`                                                        |
| **R**esponsibility |       `R=1.120` | Responsibilities `r=[0-4]`                                                              |
| **S**eniority      |       `S=1.025` | Seniority in organization `s=[0-3]`                                                     |
| Commitment         | `0.250`-`1.200` | Modifier applied to members working part-time or over-time each week                    |
| Contractor         |         `1.050` | Modifier applied to contractors who do not receive employee benefits                    |
| Geo-upscaling      |         `1.150` | Modifier applied to members living in higher cost of living regions compared to Toronto |
| Geo-downscaling    |         `0.850` | Modifier applied to members living in lower cost of living regions compared to Toronto  |
| Adjustment         |                 | Custom dollar amount adjustment applied on a case-by-case basis                         |

At salary review time, each member will perform a self-assessment to suggest their *L* and *R* to an review group made up of other members who are most suited to contribute to their evaluation. Together they will determine the appropriate values for the upcoming cycle. *S* and the *Modifiers* are based largely on objective factors, and a custom dollar amount *Adjustment* may be applied to retain members with high market demand skills, or in other special circumstances.

Salaries are reassessed at minimum annually, or more frequently, at maximum quarterly. If a new hire or existing member negotiates a higher salary, we should reassess all roles to ensure pay consistency.

## Base salaries

The table below lists *base salaries* at `S=0` in CAD for four-day work weeks. This is also called *1.00* commitment. Part-time members will have a 0.75, 0.50, 0.25 multipler proportional to their days worked per week. If a member works five-day weeks, a 1.20 multiplier is applied. *S*, *Modifiers*, and *Adjustment* are based on top of these values.

|`S=0` |R0     |R1     |R2     |R3     |R4     |
|---|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|L0 |53,844 |60,305 |67,542 |75,647 |84,725 |
|L1 |62,459 |69,954 |78,349 |87,750 |98,281 |
