# PTO Add-Ons

## Bereavement (5 Days)

If you lose someone close to you, Hypha offers up to 5 days of paid bereavement leave.

* This policy is not restricted to immediate family members.
* This policy includes pregnancy loss.
* This policy applies a 5-day paid bereavement leave to any number of lost loved ones within any given year.
* Bereavement days can be taken at any point within the year in which the loss occurs and is not restricted to immediately following a loss.

## Jury Duty

Employers are [required by law](https://www.ontario.ca/page/jury-duty-ontario#section-4) to provide time off (with protected return to their same or similar role) for individuals selected to serve as jurors. However, where "serving as a juror may cause serious hardship or loss to you or others", you can request a deferral or excusal from Jury Duty.

At this size and stage of our business, accommodating such an absence will likely cause serious hardship or loss, as we have limited resources available to satisfy our service level agreements with our clients. Serving on Jury Duty will also put you in a position of losing income, as the law does not require employers to pay an employee's salary during their time away from work, and jury duty stipends provided by the courts are limited.

Therefore, we will support your request for deferral or excusal with the required documentation, typically a letter outlining the hardship or loss. If you have been summoned for Jury Duty, please consult with the Operations Working Group for supporting documentation.

We will review this policy annually and consider further accommodations as our business evolves.

## Extended Leaves

### Pregnancy and Parental Leave

See our existing [Parental leave policy](../Policies/parental-leave.md).

This policy applies to employees who are new parents, regardless of how the child has joined the employee's family. It is inclusive of birthing parents, non-birthing parents, surrogacy, and adoptive parents.

**Government Employment Insurance Benefits**  
You may be eligible for Pregnancy and/or Parental benefits through Employment Insurance (EI) or the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP).

* *Note: When visiting the government websites, you may notice they use the word "maternity". We have adapted the language to "pregnancy" in our internal documents for inclusion purposes.*

**Government Pregnancy Benefits** are available to eligible birthing parents, including surrogates, who cannot work because they are pregnant or have recently given birth.

**Government Parental Benefits** are available to eligible parents who are caring for a newborn or newly adopted child or children. Two options are available for receiving parental benefits: [Standard Parental Benefits and Extended Parental Benefits](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-maternity-parental.html#:~:text=Maternity%20and%20parental%20benefits%20overview) ([Quebec offerings](https://www.rqap.gouv.qc.ca/en/about-the-plan/tables-of-benefits)).

Under the law, employees are entitled to take up to 18 months of job-protected leave, and we will accommodate any length of time within that 18-month boundary.

**Hypha's Salary Top-Up Program**  
Hypha has designed a Salary Top-Up Program to subsidize some of the income you lose while on a pregnancy or parental leave. Hypha will pay three months' salary, less the *assumed\** EI or QPIP payment, up to a maximum salary of 3x our base minimum salary. This top-up-cap salary is saved in the Operations Planning spreadsheet on the Salary Matrix tab.

\**Not everyone will be eligible for government EI or QPIP payments; our Top-Up Program is not dependent on a person's eligibility for EI or QPIP. In cases where the employee is not eligible for EI or QPIP, we will make payments to the employee with the same assumed EI or QPIP subtractions.*

Hypha employees are eligible for the Salary Top-Up Program for their pregnancy or parental leave for **3 out of the next 18 months** after a child (or children) arrives in the employee's family. These months do not have to be consecutive, but Hypha's salary top-up program is designed with EI payments in mind, and EI payments generally must be consecutive. There is a possibility that EI will pay for [non-consecutive weeks of parental leave](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-maternity-parental/special-circumstances.html#:~:text=Non%2Dconsecutive%20parental%20leave), but a new claim must be submitted.

*Note: Ontario requires that people re-earn their EI contributions in between leaves, but Quebec allows subsequent leaves without going back to work.*

Here are some examples of what a pay cycle might look like for employees at various levels:

Employee A (L0 R0 S0) works 4 days per week and has an annual salary of $52,531

* This employee's monthly salary is **$4,377.58**
* EI will pay 55% of the monthly salary: 0.55(4377.58) = $2,407.67 paid by EI
* Hypha will pay the balance: 4377.58 - 2407.67 = $1,969.91 paid by Hypha

Employee B (L6 R4 S3) works 5 days per week and has an annual salary of $260,249.

* This is above Hypha's top-up-cap, so we will use an annual salary of **$157,593.**
* This employee's monthly salary is **$13,132.75**
* EI will pay 55% of the monthly salary to a max of $2700: $2,700 paid by EI
* Hypha will pay the balance: 13132.75 - 2700 = $10,432.75 paid by Hypha

**Other Things to Note:**

* Giving Notice:
  * We'd love to know as soon as you're comfortable sharing your news with us so that we can plan for your transition and your time away. Technically, only 2 weeks' notice is required. However, when possible, please let us know at least 8 weeks before you plan to depart.
  * We'll make a plan together for your departure date and expected return to work date.
* While You're Away:
  * You do not earn vacation leave credits when you are on parental/pregnancy leave. However, the period of such leave counts towards your years of service for the purpose of calculating your vacation leave entitlement and other Employment Standards Act entitlements.
  * Hypha will continue to make our payments towards your employer-paid benefits plan, and you will have access to your benefits for the duration of your leave.
    * For any employee-paid benefits, Hypha will make those payments on your behalf and will work with you upon your return to create a reasonable repayment plan.
      * *Note: If you decide not to return, you will be required to remit the contributed premiums back to Hypha.*

**FAQs:**

1. **Does taking parental leave count as a month with a 0-day work week to calculate average vacation?**
   * No. Though you are not an active employee at Hypha during your leave (we submit a Leave of Absence notice to Service Canada), your vacation allotment is not impacted by parental leave. You will continue to accrue vacation time, but *not* vacation pay, meaning you will not receive vacation payout for that accrued time if you leave Hypha. Since we have a Self-Directed Vacation Policy, you will still be paid for vacation days taken from that accrued time.

2. **Does an employee continue accruing labour patronage while on parental leave?**
   * No. Labour patronage is calculated by "hours worked" as a member. During parental leave, there are no hours worked.
     1. This also means that a probationary member's probationary period would pause on the "hours worked" side but not on the "time passed" side.
3. **Does seniority pause while an employee is on parental leave?**
   * No, employee seniority does not pause.
     1. Hypha doesn't use employee seniority for anything (except for employee standards act statutory entitlements), but we do track *membership* seniority, which also will not pause.
     2. This is consistent with a probationary period not pausing on the "time passed" side.
4. **Can an employee break up months of parental leave (i.e. take 1 month of leave, work for 1 month, take 2 months of leave)?**
   * Technically, yes. It may not be practical or efficient for the employee, though. EI or QPIP payments may not allow for returning to work between leaves, and Hypha's top-up program will not compensate for a lack of EI or QPIP payments.
   * In the example for Employee B above, Hypha will pay **$10,432.75** for each month of parental leave, regardless of whether the employee is being paid by EI/QPIP or not.

### Disability Leave

This policy applies to employees who must be away from work for longer than 6 consecutive business days due to medical reasons, including illness, injury, or other health-related conditions.

While our benefits plan does not include **Short-Term Disability (STD)** coverage, employees may be eligible to access government-provided [Employment Insurance (EI) Sickness Benefits](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness.html) during this time.

* *Note: a medical certificate confirming your inability to work and the expected duration of your leave is required to apply.*

**Long-Term Disability (LTD) â€“ Co-operators Life Insurance**  
If your medical leave extends beyond 119 consecutive days (approx. 17 weeks), and you are a full-time employee at Hypha, you may be eligible for **Long-Term Disability benefits** through our group insurance provider, **Co-operators Life Insurance Company**. You can find the details of this benefit in our [Group Benefits Plan Booklet](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_c-FDihcBnqvV0hjZ7_IG25E1IxTbK71).

To apply for LTD through our insurance provider, there are a series of forms to fill out and submit through your Co-operators online portal. These forms will include a plan member section, an employer section, and a physician's section. You are responsible for filling out the plan member section and having your physician complete their section. A member of the Operations Working Group (OWG) will complete the employer's section and return it to you for submission.

Once your forms are submitted, a claims representative from the benefits provider will contact you with the next steps and support you through the process.

### Unpaid Leaves (job-protected)

There may be other circumstances where you need to take some time away from work, and Hypha will comply with all job-protected unpaid leave legislation. In some cases, you may be eligible for EI Benefits while you are away. You can find a full list of benefit options [here](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei.html).

Some common leaves include:

* [Critical Illness Leave](https://www.ontario.ca/document/your-guide-employment-standards-act-0/critical-illness-leave)
* [Family Caregiver Leave](https://www.ontario.ca/document/your-guide-employment-standards-act-0/family-caregiver-leave%20%20%20%20)
* [Family Medical Leave](https://www.ontario.ca/document/your-guide-employment-standards-act-0/family-medical-leave)

## Return To Work

Leading up to your return from any extended leave, we ask that you communicate with your Practice Area and the Operations Working Group (OWG) to confirm your return date or keep us updated on any changes to your plan. The sooner the better when it comes to sharing updates!

If you require any accommodations as part of your return, especially those recommended by a medical professional, we're happy to work with you to support a successful transition back to work.
