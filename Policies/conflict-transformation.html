<blockquote>
<p>The idea is not to eliminate conflict... The aim is to transform it.</p>
<p><em>âDiane Musho Hamilton</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone at Hypha Worker Co-operative must follow Hypha's Respect in the Workplace Policy, principles of being a good member and uphold the co-op's values when working together. These form the guidelines for our work together, along with our: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="conflict-of-values.html">Conflict of Values Philosophy</a>  </li>
<li><a href="conflict-of-interest.md">Conflict of Interest Principles</a>  </li>
<li><a href="../Communications/internal-communications.html">Internal Communication</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When conflict within the co-operative arises, which is both natural, expected, and normal, the following process should be followed. The aim is to transform the conflict into a better, or at the minimum, neutral experience for those involved. This process is designed to transform the conflict at the lowest reasonable step, escalating to higher steps as necessary.</p>
<p><em>Note: Conflict Transformation will not</em> always <em>be the appropriate avenue to navigate conflict. If your conflict feels rooted in discrimination, harassment, bullying, or any other unacceptable workplace behaviour, please refer to our Respect in the Workplace Policy for further support.</em></p>
<h2 id="step-1-personal-reflection-and-support"><a name="step-1-personal-reflection-and-support" class="plugin-anchor" href="#step-1-personal-reflection-and-support"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Step 1. Personal reflection and support</h2>
<p>Before discussing the conflict with the person(s) involved, take some time to reflect and consider the situation. Focus on understanding and naming your own feelings and reactions. If you're feeling stuck, and where possible, it's encouraged that you connect with a neutral third party (they can be a Hypha employee/member/contractor or someone outside the co-op) to discuss the situation. </p>
<p><strong>Questions to Consider During Step 1</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What happened? Can I describe the situation factually, without adding assumptions or judgments on their behaviour and intentions (or my reaction)?  </li>
<li>After some space from the incident, how am I feeling about it now? Are these feelings affecting how I see the other person or the situation?  </li>
<li>Which of my personal needs, values, or boundaries might feel breached?  </li>
<li>How much of my reaction is about this precise incident versus past experiences or patterns (either with or without this particular person)?  </li>
<li>What would resolution or repair look like for me?  </li>
<li>Is there anything I want to acknowledge or take responsibility for?  </li>
<li>Am I in the emotional and mental space to have a constructive conversation right now? If not, what would help me get there?</li>
</ul>
<p>Move to Step 2 if the situation feels unresolved after working through it individually.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-have-a-direct-conversation-with-the-person"><a name="step-2-have-a-direct-conversation-with-the-person" class="plugin-anchor" href="#step-2-have-a-direct-conversation-with-the-person"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Step 2. Have a direct conversation with the person</h2>
<p>Before engaging in discussion with the person(s) involved, consider what you want to say. Resources for framing this discussion can be found in the <a href="https://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/pdf_files/4part_nvc_process.pdf" target="_blank">NVC (non-violent communication) process</a> or the <a href="https://your.yale.edu/sites/default/files/adviformanagers_usingdesctomakeyourdifficultconversations.pdf" target="_blank">DESC (Describe, Express, Specify and Consequences) framework</a>. </p>
<p>Once you've prepared for your conversation, you can reach out to the person(s) and <em>actively name that there is a conflict</em> that you'd like to work together to resolve. </p>
<p>You've already had time to reflect and prepare; you'll want to choose a meeting date that gives them the same opportunity. </p>
<p>During the meeting, you can use the framings outlined in the suggested resources above to guide the discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Questions to Consider During Step 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Am I listening to respond? Can I shift my focus to listening to understand?   </li>
<li>Am I looking for more evidence of harm? Can I shift my mindset to assuming the best in my colleague(s)?   </li>
<li>Where can I give this person an opportunity to correct or confirm my assumptions, making statements like, "What I'm hearing isâ¦" or "Based on this conversation, I understand thatâ¦"   </li>
<li>Where can we find common ground and/or a commitment to moving forward?   </li>
<li>Am I feeling activated right now, and do I need to pause, postpone, or end this conversation? </li>
</ul>
<p>Move to Step 3 if the situation feels unresolved after working through it directly one-on-one. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There may be situations where you want to skip Step 2 and proceed directly to requesting a mediator. We'd encourage you to consider <em>why</em> you are feeling hesitant to engage directly and challenge yourself to try. However, if you're feeling <em>unsafe</em> about engaging directly with a person you're in conflict with, please review Hypha's Respect in the Workplace Policy to help you discern if an unacceptable workplace behaviour is at play and connect with a member of the Operations Working Group (OWG) for support where needed. </p>
<p>We also recognize that there are social, tenure, team/project lead, and other power dynamics at play in every organization, and that includes ours, even when we have a flat, equal-membership structure. Hypha's aspirational state is that these power dynamics are mitigated through open dialogue and active, championed practice in having the tough conversations. We know this courage is a lot to ask of you when you aren't in a position of power. Please connect with anyone on the OWG for support, coaching, or guidance when needed. There may be times when we agree that skipping Step 2 is the best option.</p>

<h2 id="step-3-engage-in-a-supported-conversation"><a name="step-3-engage-in-a-supported-conversation" class="plugin-anchor" href="#step-3-engage-in-a-supported-conversation"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Step 3. Engage in a supported conversation</h2>
<p>If you can't resolve the problem after meeting and talking it through, a neutral mediator or third-party should be brought in (note: they don't need to be a trained mediator). This person should be trusted by all involved in the conflict, and they must commit to listening to everyone equally. </p>
<p>In some cases, it may be helpful for the mediator to meet with all parties separately first to give each person the opportunity to share their perspective, context, and repair goals in a private, protected space. This can help the mediator to come into the mediation conversation holding both views and able to focus on the root issues, rather than get stuck in context building.</p>
<p>The mediator in the conversation will not seek to solve the conflict but will instead keep people focused and on track during the discussion, while encouraging them to come to a resolution to the challenge. </p>
<p>The mediator commits to active and equal listening and to asking clarifying questions throughout the discussion. These <a href="https://www.shortform.com/blog/conflict-mediation/" target="_blank">4 non-violent communications tips for mediators</a> can be used as a guide.</p>
<p><strong>Mediator Considerations During Step 3</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have I clarified the Rules of Engagement in this conversation? Examples:  <ul>
<li><strong>Go in to solve, not to win</strong>: All parties participating in a conflict transformation process should be participating to find a solution and a constructive way to move forward. If this intention is not there, the process will not work.  </li>
<li><strong>Seek to understand and respect communication norms that will set the conversation up for success</strong>: For example, it's recommended to have cameras on.  </li>
<li><strong>Default to <a href="https://www.cultureally.com/blog/nonviolent-communication-a-guide-to-empathetic-conversation" target="_blank">non-violent language</a>:</strong> Focus on sharing factual observations and how you feel (using "I" language) and communicating needs and constructive ways to move forward. We want to avoid accusatory and judgmental language (which usually appears when we use a lot of "you" language).  </li>
<li><strong>Practice active listening:</strong> This looks like listening to understand the other person, versus listening to prepare a response. If you ever want to confirm your understanding of what has just been said, you can repeat it back and check for understanding (e.g. "I am hearing that youâ¦.I want to confirm that I am understanding you correctly.")  </li>
<li><strong>Be respectful:</strong> This looks like not interrupting others when they are speaking. It also looks like not raising your voice and choosing your words carefully and thoughtfully.  </li>
<li><strong>Respect confidentiality:</strong> Both parties should respect that what is shared in this space is confidential.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have I explained my role in this meeting, the agenda for working through this conflict together, and my commitment to neutral, equal listening?  <ul>
<li>Have I clarified the shared goals of this conversation? (repair, resolution, understanding, commitments?)   </li>
<li>Have I set agreements about how we'll speak to each other in this space and how I'll navigate interruptions or escalation?   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Am I making any assumptions or showing preference?   <ul>
<li>Am I giving each person equal time and attention?   </li>
<li>Where can I give each person an opportunity to correct or confirm my assumptions, making statements like, "What I'm hearing isâ¦" or "Based on what you've shared, I understand thatâ¦"   </li>
<li>Am I asking open and clarifying questions?   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Am I keeping us all focused on uncovering the needs, values, and boundaries of each person and finding the root cause of the issue? Have I let us veer into "winning points", repeated arguments, or unrelated grievances?   </li>
<li>Can I gently name where an interpretation or assumption has been made in place of fact?   </li>
<li>Can I highlight areas of alignment and common ground, helping to shift from conflict to collaboration?  </li>
<li>Am I noticing that any of the engaged parties is showing signs of feeling activated, shut down, or defensive? If the conversation has become unsafe or unproductive, do I need to pause, postpone, or end this conversation? </li>
</ul>
<p>Move to Step 4 when a resolution cannot be reached by a mediated conversation.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-consult-a-panel-of-colleagues"><a name="step-4-consult-a-panel-of-colleagues" class="plugin-anchor" href="#step-4-consult-a-panel-of-colleagues"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Step 4. Consult a panel of colleagues</h2>
<p>If the conflict cannot be managed by direct discussion or mediation, then the next step is to convene a panel of colleagues. As Hypha does not have a group dedicated to this, the Board of Directors is tasked with either appointing a neutral and external third-party organization or participating directly by listening to both sides (presented by the neutral mediator and, in some cases, the individuals in conflict). If the conflict includes members of the Board, those parties will not be included on the panel.</p>
<p>As a clear resolution cannot be reached mutually and collaboratively, the panel of colleagues will hold the responsibility of mandating a documented, shared commitment agreement to be signed and followed by all parties. </p>
<p><em>Example:</em> </p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Our Shared Alliance</strong></th>

<tr>

<p>Move to Step 5 when a person(s) refuses to sign or breaches the commitment agreement. </p>
<h2 id="step-5-move-from-the-conflict-transformation-process-to-an-employment-matter"><a name="step-5-move-from-the-conflict-transformation-process-to-an-employment-matter" class="plugin-anchor" href="#step-5-move-from-the-conflict-transformation-process-to-an-employment-matter"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Step 5. Move from the conflict transformation process to an employment matter</h2>
<p>If the above steps are not successful in resolving the conflict, the situation will become an employment matter. At this stage, members not engaged in the conflict will be asked to gather information about the situation and recommend next steps. Irresolvable conflicts may lead to someone leaving the co-operative, referral to external authorities if relevant, and/or systemic/structural changes to the co-op.</p>
