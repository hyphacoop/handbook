<p>These policies outline our commitment to preventing and addressing all forms of discrimination, harassment (including sexual and psychological harassment), violence, and oppression. We uphold a zero-tolerance approach to such behaviours and take all concerns seriously to ensure a workplace grounded in dignity, safety, and mutual care. This zero-tolerance stance applies to all unacceptable workplace behaviour from all sources, such as members, employees, contractors, clients, and members of the public, and it applies in our co-working physical office, our online/remote working environment, at any company events, and at gatherings of colleagues not organized by Hypha.</p>

<p>Everyone at Hypha is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking reasonable steps to prevent and protect against workplace violence and harassment</li>
<li>Maintaining a safe and respectful work environment</li>
<li>Following these policies and participating in training to understand them</li>
<li>Modelling appropriate behaviour and addressing issues as they arise</li>
<li>Reporting any incidents or concerns related to harassment or violence</li>
<li>Respecting the confidentiality of all individuals involved in a report or investigation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="definitions"><a name="definitions" class="plugin-anchor" href="#definitions"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Definitions</h2>
<p>You should be aware of the following relevant terminology.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-Oppression</strong> is the commitment, dedication, and work of proactively challenging and removing oppression perpetuated by power inequalities in society: systemic oppression, microaggressions, and individual expressions of oppression.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying</strong> is interpersonal hostility that is deliberate, repeated, and sufficiently severe as to cause harm to the targeted person's health, safety, or economic status.</p>
<p><strong>Discrimination</strong> may be experienced either directly or indirectly. Direct discrimination is the unequal or unfavourable treatment on the basis of a prohibited ground, and indirect discrimination is equal treatment that has a disproportionate and negative impact on a particular individual or group.</p>
<p><strong>Equity</strong> is based on the awareness of the past and present marginalization of individuals and groups that caused, and continue to cause, barriers in accessing resources, a lack of respect in dominant society for those groups, and also corresponds to the privileging of dominant groups within society. An individual or organizational dedication to equity is an active process of regarding all decisions and basing all actions within this awareness as a means to dismantle systems that reinforce marginalization.</p>
<p><strong>Microaggression</strong> is demeaning and oppressive behaviour towards, and treatment of, a particular group or category of people expressed through individual attitudes, beliefs, and values. This may be encountered in daily activities and is most often disregarded or diminished.</p>
<p><strong>Oppression</strong> is the use/misuse of privilege and power by an economically, socially, or politically dominant group, or groups, to disempower, marginalize, silence or otherwise subordinate another social group.</p>
<p><strong>Psychological Harassment</strong> is vexatious conduct that manifests itself in written words, verbal comments, acts, behaviours, sexual gestures, or repeated actions that are hostile or unwanted, and that are likely to undermine the dignity or physical or psychological integrity of the person, or which is likely to cause a person unfavourable working conditions that make the workplace harmful.</p>
<p><strong>Systemic Oppression</strong> consists of structural, large-scale, wider practices, policies, laws and standards that disempower and disadvantage a particular group or category of people.</p>
<p><strong>The 'Workplace'</strong> includes attending any event or function on behalf of, or organized by, Hypha, including, but not limited to, in-office coworking, conferences, seminars, and social functions, or where a Hypha member, employee, or contractor has been invited to attend a function organized by a Hypha client. As members, employees, and contractors, we should also be aware that the use of email, text, Element, as well as social media platforms during work and private time, is considered an avenue for potential discrimination, harassment, or bullying.</p>
<p><strong>Workplace Harassment</strong> is technically defined as engaging in a course of vexatious comment or conduct against a worker in a workplace that is known, or ought reasonably to be known, to be unwelcome, or workplace sexual harassment. It can include behaviour that intimidates, isolates, or discriminates against the targeted individual(s), such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making remarks, jokes or innuendos that demean, ridicule, intimidate, or offend</li>
<li>Displaying or circulating offensive pictures or materials</li>
<li>Bullying</li>
<li>Discriminating or oppressing</li>
<li>Repeated offensive or intimidating phone calls, messages, or e-mails</li>
<li>Any inappropriate sexual touching, advances, suggestions or requests</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Workplace Sexual Harassment</strong> means engaging in a course of vexatious comment or conduct against a worker in a workplace because of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression, where the course of comment or conduct is known, or ought reasonably to be known, to be unwelcome.</p>
<p>It can also mean making a sexual solicitation or advance where the person making the solicitation or advance is in a position to confer, grant, or deny a benefit or advancement to the worker, and the person knows or ought reasonably to know that the solicitation or advance is unwelcome.</p>
<p>Workplace Sexual Harassment can manifest itself in particular by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advances, requests for favours, invitations or inappropriate requests of a sexual nature</li>
<li>Sexual comments, remarks about the person's body or appearance, jokes that denigrate the sexual identity or sexual orientation of the person</li>
<li>Unwanted physical contact, such as touching, pinching, tugging, or voluntary grazing</li>
<li>Threats, retaliation or other injustice associated with sexual favours</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Workplace Sexual Violence</strong>, which is any form of violence targeting sexuality or any other misconduct, including unwanted gestures, practices, comments, behaviours or attitudes with sexual connotations, whether they occur once or repeatedly, including violence relating to sexual and gender diversity.</p>
<p><strong>Workplace Violence</strong> can be defined as a threat or an act of aggression resulting in physical or psychological damage, pain or injury to a team member, which arises during work.</p>
<p>Workplace violence includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Violent or threatening physical contact (including physical intimidation)</li>
<li>Direct or indirect threats</li>
<li>Possession of a weapon on company property</li>
<li>Destructive actions against the company, members, employees, contractors, or their property</li>
<li>Threatening acts or abusive language that lead to fear</li>
<li>Domestic violence, in the context of remote work, can be considered a form of workplace violence</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Domestic Violence</strong> is defined generally as violence against a current or former spouse or intimate partner, or family member. When this violence occurs in our remote work setting, it impacts a person's safety at work.</p>

<h3 id="notes-on-definitions"><a name="notes-on-definitions" class="plugin-anchor" href="#notes-on-definitions"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Notes on Definitions</h3>
<ul>
<li>It's important to note that reasonable and lawful actions taken by Hypha, such as decisions related to performance management, discipline, work assignments, or organizational changes, do not qualify as harassment or bullying.</li>
<li>For the purposes of this policy, behaviours such as harassment, violence, discrimination, oppression, psychological harassment and sexual harassment will be referred to collectively as <strong>unacceptable workplace behaviour</strong>.</li>
<li>Discrimination or harassment may occur regardless of the intent behind the action or decision. It can be overt or subtle and may take verbal, written, visual, physical, or other forms of conduct.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="options--actions-following-unacceptable-workplace-behaviour"><a name="options--actions-following-unacceptable-workplace-behaviour" class="plugin-anchor" href="#options--actions-following-unacceptable-workplace-behaviour"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Options &amp; Actions Following Unacceptable Workplace Behaviour</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Operations Working Group (Ops) is always available to support and assist in resolving concerns, regardless of severity.</p>
<h3 id="1-conflict-transformation-process"><a name="1-conflict-transformation-process" class="plugin-anchor" href="#1-conflict-transformation-process"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1. Conflict Transformation Process</h3>
<p>If you feel safe, you're encouraged to address the issue directly using our <a href="conflict-transformation.html">Conflict Transformation process</a>.</p>
<h3 id="2-formal-internal-investigation"><a name="2-formal-internal-investigation" class="plugin-anchor" href="#2-formal-internal-investigation"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>2. Formal Internal Investigation</h3>
<p>If the issue isn't resolved through the Conflict Transformation process, or if it's more serious*, a formal investigation may be necessary. Ops will lead this process and may seek external HR or Legal guidance where appropriate.</p>
<p>In any case where a member of Ops is involved (as a complainant, respondent, or witness), the formal investigation process will default to an external body, such as an HR or Legal representative.</p>
<p><strong>*What Constitutes a "Serious" Issue?</strong> That's truly for you to decide. We can't tell you what feels serious to you. Even a single incident may be considered serious if it has a strong impact or involves particularly harmful behaviour. If you're unsure whether a concern rises to this level, Ops can help you determine the most appropriate next step.</p>
<h3 id="3-formal-external-investigation"><a name="3-formal-external-investigation" class="plugin-anchor" href="#3-formal-external-investigation"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>3. Formal External Investigation</h3>
<p>At any time, you have the right to file a formal complaint with an external body, such as the Human Rights Commission or local authorities. Hypha will fully cooperate with any external investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If Hypha becomes aware of a potential incident involving harassment, discrimination, or violence, we are required to conduct an appropriate investigation, even if the individual does not wish to file a formal complaint.</p>
<h2 id="reporting"><a name="reporting" class="plugin-anchor" href="#reporting"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Reporting</h2>
<p>Everyone at Hypha shares the responsibility to report any incidents of unacceptable workplace behaviour to the Operations Working Group, whether they experienced it directly, witnessed it, or had it disclosed to them.</p>
<p>If you prefer to report anonymously, you can use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddg_m_lPwPgul8KjRRAI8rA8mje8ufUxb04MPM17wroGACIg/viewform?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=114380782931041961771" target="_blank">this confidential Google Form</a> to share concerns. While anonymous reports may limit our ability to fully investigate or follow up with you, they will still be taken seriously and reviewed by Ops with care and discretion.</p>
<p>Whether you are reporting anonymously or not, the following information will be helpful to have on record for our understanding and investigative purposes if you have these details:</p>
<ul>
<li>The approximate date and time of each incident you wish to report</li>
<li>The name of the person or persons involved in each incident</li>
<li>The name of any person or persons who witnessed each incident</li>
<li>A full description of what occurred in each incident</li>
<li>Any supporting documentation that you, a witness, or the harasser(s) (now the "respondent(s)") may possess (example: screenshots of received messages)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="confidentiality"><a name="confidentiality" class="plugin-anchor" href="#confidentiality"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Confidentiality</h2>
<p>We understand that coming forward can be difficult. All reports of unacceptable workplace behaviour, and the identities of those involved, will be kept confidential to the fullest extent reasonably possible. Information will only be shared when necessary to investigate the concern, ensure the safety of others, take appropriate action, or comply with legal obligations.</p>
<p>We do not share or act on allegations outside the necessary steps of an investigation.</p>
<h2 id="complaint-resolution-principles"><a name="complaint-resolution-principles" class="plugin-anchor" href="#complaint-resolution-principles"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Complaint Resolution Principles</h2>
<p>When a complaint is made, the following principles guide our process:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Freedom from Repercussions:</strong> No one will face discipline or retaliation for reporting an incident or participating in an investigation. Any retaliation will be treated as serious misconduct.</li>
<li><strong>Clear Communication:</strong> All parties will be informed about what to expect throughout the process and once it concludes.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Everyone Involved:</strong> All individuals will have the opportunity to share their perspective. Respondents will be informed of the allegations, and all parties will be offered appropriate support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional resources and support can be found through the <a href="https://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/hs/pubs/fs_wvh_atwork.php" target="_blank">Ministry of Labour</a>.</p>
<h2 id="complaint-investigation-steps"><a name="complaint-investigation-steps" class="plugin-anchor" href="#complaint-investigation-steps"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Complaint Investigation Steps</h2>
<p>Where an internal or external investigation is required, the following steps will be taken by Hypha and/or the engaged HR and/or Legal consultant:</p>
<ol>
<li>The "respondent(s)" will be informed of the complaint</li>
<li>The "complainant(s)" will be interviewed, as well as any person involved in the incident and any identified witnesses</li>
<li>Any other person who may have knowledge of the incidents related to the complaint or any other similar incidents will also be interviewed</li>
<li>A copy of the written complaint detailing the complainant's allegations will then be provided to the respondent(s)</li>
<li>The respondent(s) is invited to reply in writing to the complainant's allegations, and the reply will be made known to the complainant before the investigation proceeds further</li>
<li>A written report of the result of an investigation and any remedial action will be given to the employees involved, and appropriate disciplinary measures will be taken as soon as possible</li>
</ol>
<p>All documents associated with a workplace harassment complaint, incident, and/or investigation will be kept for a minimum of two years from the conclusion of the investigation.</p>
<p>Hypha will take appropriate corrective action with respect to any worker who subjects another to harassment. Anyone found in violation of this policy may be disciplined, up to and including termination of employment, depending upon the circumstances involved.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-case-of-workplace-violence"><a name="in-the-case-of-workplace-violence" class="plugin-anchor" href="#in-the-case-of-workplace-violence"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>In the Case of Workplace Violence</h2>
<p>Many of the same steps outlined in our general Options &amp; Actions Following Unacceptable Workplace Behaviour apply here, such as reporting (with as much detail as possible as listed above), investigation, confidentiality, and corrective action. However, due to the nature and severity of workplace violence, additional steps may be necessary.</p>
<p>In situations involving violence or the risk of immediate harm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trust your judgment. If you feel unsafe, leave the area.</li>
<li>Call 911 for emergency police or medical assistance if needed.</li>
<li>Hypha will act quickly to ensure the safety of everyone, which may include disciplinary action, involving external investigators, and/or contacting police or authorities where required by law.</li>
</ul>
<p>We recognize that not everyone feels safe involving the police. If you are unsure or hesitant, please reach out to Ops for guidance. We'll support you in navigating the next steps in a way that centres your safety and comfort.</p>
<p>Hypha will investigate all reports thoroughly and respectfully. Where criminal behaviour is involved, our internal process does not replace a police investigation but may run in parallel.</p>
<p>Anyone found to have committed an act of workplace violence will face disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and may also be subject to legal consequences.</p>
<h2 id="support-in-situations-of-domestic-violence"><a name="support-in-situations-of-domestic-violence" class="plugin-anchor" href="#support-in-situations-of-domestic-violence"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Support in Situations of Domestic Violence</h2>
<p>We understand that domestic violence can impact individuals at work, especially in remote environments. If you're experiencing domestic violence, or become aware of a situation that could pose a risk to a team member, you are encouraged to report it to Hypha Ops so we can take steps to help ensure safety.</p>
<p>Hypha will take every reasonable precaution to support and protect affected individuals. This may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a personalized safety plan in collaboration with the team member</li>
<li>This may include financial considerations and support</li>
<li>Sharing relevant resources and support services</li>
<li>Offering flexible work arrangements, paid leave (vacation or sick time), and job-protected leave as outlined by provincial law</li>
</ul>
<p>If the perpetrator is an employee or business contact of Hypha, our broader anti-violence policy applies in full.</p>
<p>We recognize the deeply personal nature of domestic violence. Any information shared will be kept confidential and only disclosed when necessary to ensure safety or as required by law.</p>
<h2 id="bad-faith-complaints"><a name="bad-faith-complaints" class="plugin-anchor" href="#bad-faith-complaints"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Bad Faith Complaints</h2>
<p>Knowingly making false, frivolous, or malicious allegations, or providing false or intentionally misleading information during an investigation, will be treated as serious misconduct. This may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination for cause. Please note that an unproven allegation is not necessarily deliberately false or made in bad faith.</p>
<h2 id="work-related-social-activities"><a name="work-related-social-activities" class="plugin-anchor" href="#work-related-social-activities"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Work-Related Social Activities</h2>
<p>Whether at a team dinner, virtual happy hour, off-site retreat, or other work-related social gathering, everyone at Hypha is expected to uphold the same respectful, inclusive, and professional behaviour as they would during regular working hours. These events are considered extensions of the workplace, and all company policies on harassment, discrimination, and violence still apply.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Joking that is inappropriate in a meeting is still inappropriate at a team lunch</li>
<li>Consuming alcohol is never an excuse for disrespectful or harmful behaviour</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-closing"><a name="in-closing" class="plugin-anchor" href="#in-closing"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>In Closing</h2>
