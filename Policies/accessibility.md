# Accessibility Policy

Hypha is committed to ensuring accessibility for all clients, employees, and members. This policy outlines our compliance with the [Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act 2005](https://www.ontario.ca/page/about-accessibility-laws#section-1) and the [Standard sur l'accessibilité des sites Web du gouvernement du Québec](https://www.quebec.ca/gouvernement/ministeres-organismes/cybersecurite-numerique/publications/standard-accessibilite-sites-web).

## Scope

This policy applies to all clients accessing our services, including clients, patrons, third parties, business associates, employees, members, and candidates.

## Communication & Service Disruptions

We consider individual accessibility needs when communicating and will notify clients of any service disruptions that impact accessibility.

Information available to the public, including emergency plans, will be provided in accessible formats upon request at no cost. We'll collaborate with the requester to meet their specific needs, which may include support like reading documents aloud.

Our website and web content are accessible to WCAG 2.0 level AA standards, as assessed by tools such as WCAG Contrast Checker, axe DevTools and WAVE.

## Feedback

We welcome feedback about our accessibility. Clients can provide feedback via:

- **Email:** [operations@hypha.coop](mailto:operations@hypha.coop)
- **Mail:** PO box #1308-1403 Royal York Road, Etobicoke, Ontario M9P 0A1

## Training

Hypha team members receive AODA training, and new hires are trained during onboarding. We ensure that all third-party vendors are also appropriately trained.

## Employment & Workplace Accommodations

For employees and members specifically, we commit to accommodating individual needs relating to disabilities. Upon disclosure, we will collaborate to determine accommodations, consulting external experts as needed, and maintain privacy wherever possible.

Employees should contact the Operations Working Group to initiate the accommodation process.

We also provide:

- Individualized Return to Work plans after disability leave
- Accessible workplace communication and emergency information
- Individualized emergency plans, as needed
- Consideration of accommodation needs in performance management, career development, and redeployment
- Accommodations are available at all stages of the recruitment and hiring process

## Neuroaccessibility

In our remote work environment, neuroaccessibility includes:

- Flexible schedules
- Clear communication practices such as meeting notes, decision logs, and documented policies & procedures
- Inclusive digital collaboration using shared synchronous and asynchronous tools

We expect everyone at Hypha to foster a workplace where all neurotypes are respected, supported, and equitably included in leadership, innovation, and success by:

- Normalizing inclusive communication, like using unambiguous language and offering multiple ways to contribute
- Reinforcing that behaviours like directness, stimming, and camera-off aren't a "lack of professionalism"
- Establishing norms that respect different working styles, like "no pressure to turn cameras on," or "share agenda/questions in advance"

## Policy Review

This policy will be reviewed annually and updated as needed to ensure continued compliance with accessibility standards and best practices.
