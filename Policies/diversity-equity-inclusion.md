# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Philosophy

## Purpose

This Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion statement isn't just about our belief system; it outlines how we *integrate* DE&I into our everyday operations, decision-making, actions, and culture. It sets clear expectations for how Hypha functions collectively.

## Definitions

**Diversity:** Diversity is the presence and representation of a wide range of identities, backgrounds, lived experiences, and perspectives within our team at Hypha. Recognizing diversity means valuing the individual and collective differences at Hypha as essential to building a strong community that drives creativity, innovation, and better decision-making.

**Equity:** Equity means "levelling the playing field," through ensuring fair access to resources and opportunities, recognizing different starting points, providing tailored support, and removing systemic barriers so everyone can thrive.

**Inclusion:** Inclusion means designing and maintaining an environment where everyone feels respected, *valued*, and able to contribute fully. It fosters a sense of belonging, ensures equitable access to success, and actively seeks diverse perspectives so all members can be their true selves and do their best work at Hypha.

## Commitments in Practice

At Hypha, we're committed to building and maintaining a working environment where folks of all backgrounds, identities, and lived experiences are respected and supported. This looks like: 

* **Hiring & Onboarding**: Inclusive and accommodating recruitment practices, clear expectations, and accessible onboarding.  
* **Compensation & Advancement**: Pay equity, [transparent and member-led decision-making](https://handbook.hypha.coop/Policies/salary-review.html), and the fair distribution of opportunities and recognition.  
* **Day-to-Day Work**: [Respectful communication](Communications/internal-communications.md), accessible [meetings](https://handbook.hypha.coop/How-we-work/meetings.html) and [documents](https://handbook.hypha.coop/Policies/working-open.html), and [inclusive decision-making processes](https://handbook.hypha.coop/Hypha-Worker-Co-operative/co-operative-principles.html#:~:text=Democratic%20Member%20Control).  
* **Policy Development**: All new and updated policies are drafted and reviewed through a DEI lens before implementation. This means using intentional, inclusive language and considering and mitigating how any policy directly or indirectly negatively impacts a particular individual or group.   
* **Conflict & Accountability**: Clear processes for [transforming conflict](conflict-transformation.md) and [responding to interpersonal incidents](../Operations/interpersonal-incident-response.md), including breaches to our [Respect in the Workplace policy](respect-in-workplace.md).   
* **External Representation**: Ensuring our [external communications](Communications/social-media-policy.md), [partnerships](conflict-of-values.md), and public-facing work align with DEI values.

## Responsibilities

**All Members:** We should all strive to practice inclusion in our daily interactions, decision-making, and representation of the co-op.

**Operations Working Group**: The OWG should ensure that policies, hiring practices, and internal processes reflect our DEI commitments.

**Board**: The board should champion this work, provide resource allocation, and ensure accountability.
