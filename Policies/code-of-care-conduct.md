# Code of Care & Conduct

## August 2025

## Purpose

*How* we work together matters just as much as the work itself. This landing page pulls together our commitments, expectations, and practices that support a respectful, collaborative, and accountable workplace. These guidelines are meant to provide clarity on how we uphold our shared values, navigate challenges, and ensure a safe and supportive working environment for everyone at Hypha.

## Our Approach

It's pretty simple:

* We treat each other with respect.  
* We communicate openly, kindly, and constructively.  
* We address conflicts directly and with the intention of understanding and resolving.  
* We are mindful of power, privilege, and impact.  
* We support one another in building a cooperative culture.
