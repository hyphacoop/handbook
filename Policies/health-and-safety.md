# Occupational Health and Safety Policy

Hypha will make all reasonable efforts to comply with the government regulations pertaining to health and safety:
- Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA)
- The Act Respecting Occupational Health and Safety (AOHS)
- All applicable Codes of Practice and Canadian Standards

Everyone at Hypha:
- Must be dedicated to the continuing objective of reducing the risk of workplace injury and illness
- Must protect their own health and safety by working in compliance with the law and with safe work practices and procedures established by Hypha
- Will receive information and annual training to protect their health and safety

## Core Things You Should Know to Keep Us All Safe

### Your Responsibilities

**As an employer, you must:**
- Make sure employees and members know about the hazards and dangers in the workplace and how to work safely
- Make sure every employee and member knows how to take care of health and safety on the job (in lieu of formal supervisors)
- Create health and safety policies and procedures for the workplace
- Make sure everyone knows and follows the health and safety procedures
- Do everything reasonable to keep employees and members from getting hurt or sick on the job

**As an employee/member, you must:**
- Follow the law and the workplace health and safety policies and procedures
- Work and act in a way that won't hurt you or any other employee or member

### Your Rights

- **The right to know:** You have the right under the OHSA to be told about the hazards in the work you do and to be instructed on how to do your work safely
- **The right to report:** It's against the law for your employer to punish you in any way for doing what the OHSA says or for asking your employer to do what the OHSA expects them to do
- **The right to refuse:** You have the right to refuse to do unsafe work if you have reason to believe it puts you or a fellow worker in danger

## Your Potential Hazards

### Ergonomics

The ergonomics at your remote work station are the primary potential hazard that you need to be mindful of while working at Hypha. Repeating the same movements over and over, especially if you are in an awkward position, can cause long-term injuries. In our line of work, typing and using a mouse are the repetitive movements we're talking about. If your body is out of ergonomic alignment while repeating these movements, you may be at risk.

As a remote-first workplace, employees and members are responsible for the ergonomics of their own workspace.

**Required:** Everyone at Hypha is required to complete this [Home Office Workstation Checklist](https://www.wsps.ca/resource-hub/worker/home-office-workstation-checklist) during the first 2 weeks of your onboarding. Please download the form, follow the instructions included, and complete the checklist. Once completed, please email your completed form to [operations@hypha.coop](mailto:operations@hypha.coop).

On a continuous basis, Hypha will require everyone to complete this form annually in January.

### Overwork & Burnout

Overwork & Burnout are recognized as workplace hazards that can affect mental, emotional, and physical well-being. In a cooperative environment, we each have a role to play in recognizing and reducing these risks — for ourselves and for one another.

To support a healthier work culture, all team members are encouraged to:
- Set and communicate clear boundaries around work hours
- Take regular breaks and use earned time off
- Check in with peers and flag signs of stress or overload early
- Reflect on workload regularly and adjust priorities or seek support as needed

### Social Connection

When working remotely, it can be difficult to maintain social connections, both with coworkers and other people in your life. We encourage employees to be mindful of their social needs and develop strategies for meeting their needs both in and outside of the workplace. Some strategies for maintaining social connections with coworkers:

- Regular 1x1 meetings with people on other project teams, such as 30 minutes every other week
- Attending org-wide social calls, such as coffee breaks or social hangs
- Working outside of your residence, such as in a coworking space, library, or café. Be mindful of client privacy and internet safety when using unsecured networks!
- Disconnect from work obligations outside of working hours to give yourself time to dedicate to family, friends, and other social activities
- Talking to other remote employees about the strategies they use to stay connected :)

## Physically Co-located Work

When working in the same physical location, we encourage you to inquire who on the current Hypha team has formal first aid training and certification.
