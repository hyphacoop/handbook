# Expense Reimbursement

Employees should submit expenses in the same quarter they are incurred.
The Finance WG reviews submitted expenses before each pay period, and pays out reimbursements for out of pocket expenses on the next pay day.

## Submitting an expense (Employees)

1. Email the expense receipt to finance@hypha.coop with the following information:
  * Date of expense
  * Description
  * Total amount
  * HST amount, if applicable
  * Currency
  * Exchange rate, if the currency is other than CAD
  * Practice area ("Internal" if it's a Hypha expense)
  * Was this paid with a Hypha credit card or out of pocket?
  * Note if this expense falls under one of the following:
    * Member and co-op development
    * Solidarity to movement-building projects

If you paid for the expense out of pocket, you will be reimbursed on the following pay day as part of payroll. The amount will _not_ appear on your tax forms.

## Processing an expense (Finance WG)

### Recording: Hypha Credit Card

1. Forward the receipt to Quickbooks Online.
2. If the expense is marked with a reserve fund category, add it to the relevant expenses list in the `Financial Planning` spreadsheet.

### Recording: Out of Pocket

Follow the Recording steps when a receipt for an out-of-pocket expense arrives in the finance inbox.

1. Upload the receipt to ðŸ”’ [Employee Expense Receipts](https://link.hypha.coop/receipts) folder with the file name `xx-YYYY-MM-DD-title.ext`, where:
  * `xx` is the employee initials
  * `title` describes the expense
  * `ext` is the file extension
  
2. Save the file URL (right click -> `Share` -> `Copy link`).

3. Open the ðŸ”’ [Employee Expenses](https://link.hypha.coop/expenses) sheet and fill in a new row using the data provided in the email. Enter the URL for the receipt from the previous step in the `Receipt Link` column.

4. If the expense is marked with a reserve fund category, add it to the relevant expenses list in the `Financial Planning` spreadsheet.


### Reimbursement

Follow the Reimbursement steps as part of the Confirm Wages step in the [Payroll process](payroll.md).

1. Open the ðŸ”’ [Employee Expenses](https://link.hypha.coop/expenses) sheet.

2. Verify all expenses that do not have a `Pay Period of Reimbursement` selected.

3. Enter a `Cost Center / Project` and `Pay Period of Reimbursement` for pending expenses.

4. Verify that the `Total Amount (CAD)` is added to the ðŸ”’ [Reimbursement Summary](http://link.hypha.coop/reimbursement) sheet for the correct `Pay Period of Reimbursement` and `Employee`.

5. Verify that the amount shows up correctly on the `Expense Reimbursement` column on ðŸ”’ [Employee Payroll](http://link.hypha.coop/payroll) of the applicable pay period, so it gets entered into Wagepoint as part of the payroll process.

After reimbursements are paid out through Wagepoint, the bookkeeper will file the the amounts into expense accounts in [Quickbooks Online](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/ca/) based on the ðŸ”’ [Posting Journals](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1wWo9KqNwWdUK5d-jkApV3id_Y_dpftT9) and ðŸ”’ [Employee Expenses](https://link.hypha.coop/expenses) sheet.
