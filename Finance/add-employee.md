# Add a New Employee

Follow this guide to add a new employee in Wagepoint.

1. Log into Wagepoint as a user with admin privileges.
2. Click the `EMPLOYEES` tab and then the `ADD NEW EMPLOYEE` button at the bottom right corner.
3. Add stub details for new employee.
    Since we calculate wages per pay period outside of Wagepoint, set:
    -  Pay Type: `Yearly`
    -  Pay Rate: `0`
4. Return to the `EMPLOYEES` tab and click the Employee's name.
    - You should now be on their profile, specifically `THE PERSON` tab, which you can fill out with info from our [employee records](https://link.hypha.coop/employees).
    - Make sure to use a personal email, not the @hypha email so that the employee gets tax-related emails even after they leave Hypha.
    - Fill out everything you can, but leave `External ID` blank.
5. In the `THE JOB` tab, set up the Employee with the salaried method:
    - Pay Type: `Yearly`
    - Annual Salary: `$0.00`
    - Expected Hour per Week: `0.00`
    - Job Title: `No title`
    - Department: `Salary`
    - Vacation will: `not be applicable`
6. In the `TAX INFO` tab, set up the Employee's tax info based on the `TD1` and `TD1-ON` forms they submitted.
7. In the `DIRECT DEPOSIT` tab, set up the bank account for direct deposit based on account information or a void cheque they submitted.
8. Return to the "Employee" tab listing, and use the "mail" icon to send an invite to the Employee to Wagepoint.
