# Sending Invoices

The process for collecting payments from clients is as follows:
1. The project lead enters the billing information for the relevant time period in the `Financial Planning` spreadsheet.
2. A member of the Finance Working Group (WG) creates an invoice and sends it to the client using QuickBooks Online using the information from the spreadsheet.
3. The Operations Coordinator settles the invoice payment after it is received.
4. Monthly bookkeeping and reconciliation of books.

## 1. Populate Financial Planning Spreadsheet (Project Lead)

If this is the first time the client is being invoiced:
  * Confirm with the client which currency they will be invoiced in, and in what country their financial institution is based.
  * Work with the Finance WG to set up the right invoice template and cost centres.

Go to the `Customer Invoices` sheet of the `Financial Planning` spreadsheet and fill in the details for the invoice:
  * `Period`: It should match the upcoming Service Period at the top of the sheet.
  * `Service Date`: The end date of the provided service. If a client is billed monthly, this would list the last day of the billed month.
  * `Description`
  * `Qty`
  * `Rate (<currency>)`
  * `Sales Tax`
* Notify the Finance WG that the invoice data is ready.

> Access to the `Financial Planning` spreadsheet is controlled by the Finance WG.

## 3. Accounts Receivable on client invoices (Operations Coordinator)

Before sending new ones, review invoices from the previous month(s) in Quickbooks, and send reminders on any items that are overdue.

Ensure each client has paid their invoices each month, and these payments have been matched and applied to invoices in Quickbooks (QB). Most of these come through Wise, or by cheque and direct deposit to our Desjardins account. Refresh feeds in QB to ensure the most up-to-date transactions are available. Invoices are Net 15, and are due roughly mid-month depending on when they were sent out
