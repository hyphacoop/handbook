# Paying Invoices


## New contractors

Prior to paying the first invoice for a contractor:
- If there was no notice of a new contractor/invoice to be paid, confirm invoice with project lead.
- Confirm what currency the invoice is in. If not in CAD make sure it is identified somewhere on the invoice.
- Confirm with contractor and project lead in what currency they would be paid in (CAD, USD, EUR, or GBP).
- Collect banking details from contractor and enter them into Wise.
- After entering the banking information, provide screenshot to contractor to confirm.
